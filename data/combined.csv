I was reading Toyota's EV plans when I was surprised to see that they thought that having 33% EV production by 2030 might not be enough \[1\]. When I looked up some EV sales projections, several seemed to suggest that global sales might account for 30% \[2, 3\] of the market. Even 30% of the market seems ambitious to me, many Americans don't have garages \[4\] and I doubt that half of the Americans that do will have the resources to or want to install a charging station in their homes. To be fair there are other forces that will encourage consumers to buy EVs including a 'planned' ban on gas powered passenger vehicles in some states \[5\] by 3035. Though I just assumed those bans ambitious goals vs planned reality. 

Am I missing something? Is it obvious that we're going to start seeing over 33% of new cars be EV sales in just 7 years? Given current conditions I don't see it happening.

21,1671923265.0,RealTesla,To r/RealTesla: thank you.,"I've been wanting to write a post like this here ever since I replaced my Tesla with a Ford Mustang Mach-E back in August. It will probably be my last post I make on Reddit, and the one that matters to me the most. 

Below is a crosspost of [a comment I posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/ztxz5e/comment/j1grw0m/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) to r/electricvehicles in response to someone asking why there are some people who hate Tesla. Obviously got a controversial response on that subreddit, but I feel it deserves to be here as well. Side note: I added some more details here compared to the original comment.

\------

My EV journey basically started on Jan 4th when I reserved a Ford Mustang Mach-E to replace my old gas-powered Lexus sedan. In addition to the more responsive acceleration from an EV, I needed more cargo room to fit my foldable bike and watersports gear, so a small SUV was the way to go. I had previously reserved a VW ID4 on December 2021 but was concerned about lack of info on wait times, performance, and features compared to the Ford. 

For the Ford however I also later became a little pessimistic about the 5-6 month wait, looking up posts, fearing more delays, having to potentially wait a year, etc. Started to look at Tesla, liked the numbers, performance, and the (supposedly) much shorter wait time. Liked how Tesla was fighting the supply chain crisis with their strategy on chips and planning the Texas factory, not knowing at the time how they were getting away with it behind the scenes. Fell for the videos posted by Sandy comparing the Mach-E with Teslas (later realizing he was a blatant pro-Tesla propagandist for the most part). I ended up doing four test drives between their Model 3 and Model Y at a nearby showroom and liked the acceleration among other things. The Ford dealerships on the other hand did not have any Mach-E's to test drive. Decided to order their Model Y Performance on Feb 18th, cancelled the ID4 reservation via their website, and was contemplating cancelling my Ford order which I had to do via phone call.

To this day I still thank my social anxiety/hesitation with phone calls for ultimately not cancelling the Ford.

Shortly after, I discovered a certain subreddit (you guys) via another Redditor's comment (forgot which one) that let's just say showed a little more of the truthful side of Tesla. My Tesla delivery ETA at the same time went from less than a month to nearly four months (which was the reason for creating this Reddit account at the time) and I started to realize I was being lied to. One of those said build time delays from Tesla on March 20th led me to make this account [in order to vent here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/comments/timpb7/i_need_to_vent_about_teslas_misleading/)

Following [an attempt](https://www.reddit.com/r/Polestar/comments/tjucim/considering_a_polestar_2_am_i_making_the_right/) to try Polestar [which ultimately we decided not to go forward with](https://www.reddit.com/r/Polestar/comments/tp6yg5/my_honest_thoughts_on_the_polestar_2_after_two/), I begun to have some hope regarding Tesla. I figured since there were so much more Teslas on the road than other EV's, then that's why we're seeing all these more frequent issues compared to the competition, right? I think there's a certain fallacy on that, but don't know off it the top of my head. Luckily I had a backup plan: Do not cancel the Ford, but get the Tesla, and I either keep it or sell it as a trade-in for the Mach-E depending on if all these Tesla horror stories were true.

Unfortunately in my case they were right. Upon picking up and driving the car three months later than what was originally advertised, there was a high pitched whine coming from the rear motor whenever cruising. This was not present in the Model Y I test drove at the showroom. Later discovered they never installed a 'penthouse perimeter seal' on my car meant to prevent that noise. The road nose was really bad especially at highway speeds - almost as though there was no noise insulation between me and the tires. The rattles were non-stop - I tried to fix some with some Gorilla tape but the whole vehicle felt like it was loosely bolted together with each bump. In a way it was torture. Then I was hearing online about the drive motor failures and that got me especially concerned about using this car for longer drives. And yes I had two service center experiences as well - once to deal with a loose seat adjustment motor that was making noise, and another to install a garage door opener. Luckily I lived close to the service center and was given Uber credits at the time - they don't to the credits anymore last I checked.

Ultimately, I had to let it go. Near the end of August, the Ford was finally delivered to the dealership and I picked it up, trading in my Tesla and getting back some trade in money in the process. The Ford dealership had no markups on my car either and were able to negotiate the Tesla's price which was an added bonus. Four months later, the only issue I've had with the Ford was a small rattle that I was eventually able to fix by myself and it's been quiet ever since.

You can see [my review of both cars here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachE/comments/wsxeuu/model_y_performance_vs_mach_e_route_1_my_first/)

and [a video comparing the rattle noise of both cars here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachE/comments/wsrfdm/the_amount_of_rattles_and_noises_in_a_tesla_model/).

So yes, there is a reason for all this 'crazy Tesla hate'. In my year of learning about and driving Tesla, here are just some of the answers to \[OP's\] question:

\- Service center nightmares

\- Phantom braking

\- Random drive motor failures causing the vehicle to stop in the middle of a highway

\- Over-exaggerating the estimated range

\- Constant rattling in their vehicles (at least in my case when I had one for less than 3 months)

\- Severe build quality issues

\- Teslas catching fire randomly

\- No more loaner cars or Uber credits for service center appointments

\- Suspension failures (look up 'whompy wheels')

\- They're not exactly waterproof when it comes to car washes

\- Removing features such as ultrasonic sensors while simultaneously increasing the price

\- Auto high-beams and wipers, or lack thereof

\- More recently, Teslas randomly accelerating on their own and causing crashes as a result

And that's not including the Elon stuff.

Now is not the time to buy a Tesla.

\---------

Adding to the above comment I made, I think this Christmas Eve would have been very different for me had I \*not\* discovered this subreddit and went ahead to blindly cancel the Mach-E reservation, not knowing what would come next. I could not even imagine being stuck with that Tesla for the rest of the year, waiting for a replacement EV amidst this worsening supply chain and pricing crisis. Who knows if, in that time period, I would have suffered a phantom braking or motor failure incident in my Tesla that could have resulted in serious injury to me or others?

You guys, in a way, saved my life. Thank you all. &lt;3",0.82,80.0,0.0,80.0,,2022-12-24T23:07:45Z,zul5qi,t3

45,1671807587.0,RealTesla,The Infamous NHTSA,"I have been noticing an uptick on Mastodon (and reposts from Twitter on Mastodon) on the ability or inability of the NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) to rein in Tesla given the [latest Autopilot investigation developments](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/22/nhtsa-initiates-two-more-tesla-crash-investigations.html).

More than that, on my recent posts to this sub, I have noticed some comments intended to defend Tesla by way of noting that the NHTSA has not (yet) seriously checked Tesla on Autopilot or FSD Beta wrongdoings - essentially arguing that the NHTSA is endorsing the safety of Tesla's systems.

For many long-time members of this sub, this will be a review... but I thought it best to include a high-level overview of what is really going on here.

First off, the NHTSA is an ***extremely*** ineffective automotive regulator (\*).

Full stop.

About every four (4) years or so the USDOT OIG (US Department of Transportation's Office of Inspector General) issues a highly-scathing report detailing the ineffectiveness of the NHTSA in protecting the public.

Here is the [latest report](https://www.oig.dot.gov/library-item/38698) issued in 2021.

And here is the [2018 report](https://www.autosafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DOT-IG-NHTSA-Auto-Recalls-Final-Report-07-18-18.pdf).

And [here](https://www.oig.dot.gov/library-item/32994) is a 2016 report where the OIG is lambasting the NHTSA for still not being in compliance with a [2011 report](https://www.oig.dot.gov/library-item/28597).

I could back further, but I think that my point is made.

It should be noted that these OIG investigations are not automatic.

Instead, they are launched due to persistent, habitual enforcement issues and against a backdrop of a [rapidly deteriorating US roadway safety situation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2022/08/17/traffic-deaths-us-roads/).

A common feature in these reports notes the anemic staffing levels at the NHTSA and a wholesale lack of technical skill sets necessary to quickly identify even simple mechanical defects (let alone, complex, opaque automated driving systems).

The FMVSS (Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard), the authoritative tome of US automotive regulations, it likely a decade or more out-of-date - even putting aside the NHTSA's inflexible, dogmatic idolization of it in the face of rapidly changing technologies.

Let me cut to the chase.

The NHTSA spends its days on two (2) major, high-level tasks:

1. Maintaining an ""Honor Code"" between the NHTSA and automakers; and
2. Maintaining avenues of plausible deniability to protect the agency from future accusations of inaction.

The NHTSA wants to, at all costs, avoid direct legal confrontation with automakers.

It has neither the skill sets nor the enforcement budget to credibly do so - and the NHTSA knows it.

Unless the NHTSA has an automaker dead-to-rights (or the headlines get large enough), the NHTSA is going to defer to the automaker.

That is where #2 comes in.

The NHTSA is constantly collecting a paper trial and constantly writing to and e-mailing automakers.

We have seen some of this activity through various FOIA requests over the years.

This is done in an effort to protect the agency so when the next Big Automotive Safety Scandal blows up and the NHTSA is hauled before Congress for an explanation, the NHTSA can just claim that the target automaker lied to them (\*\*).

Sure, by that time, the public was unnecessarily harmed.

People were injured and killed in ways that were completely avoidable.

But that is hardly the NHTSA's problem in their eyes, quite frankly. After all, the NHTSA's default position is to blame the human driver for every incident.

Congress too, which passes laws that later flow down into FMVSS regulations, has little motivation to criticize itself while putting the NHTSA under the hot lights.

The Circle of Inaction is now complete.

And so there we have it.

As a ""post script"" of sorts... let us touch on a ""random"" Tesla-related NHTSA investigation (I just searched Google for ""Tesla NHTSA closes investigation"" and chose the first result):

[NHTSA determines sudden acceleration complaints in Tesla vehicles were due to driver error](https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/nhtsa-tesla-sudden-unintended-acceleration-driver-error/)

Without even reading the article or without even having the benefit of NHTSA documents obtained by a FOIA process, here is undoubtedly the sequence of events that took place:

1. NHTSA opens an investigation due to public pressure or, more rarely, a noted rise in vehicle complaints.
2. NHTSA asks Tesla for a written response to several questions pertinent to the investigation.
3. Tesla denies that its systems are defective.
4. NHTSA closes the investigation by blaming the human driver (since there has to be ***some*** reason for the rise in incidents).

This basic sequence of events is also a common feature in nearly every USDOT OIG report.

Have a Happy Holiday and, if you are traveling on the road, please be safe!

He also has very specific points. His latest tweet storm is about the spending bill, he clearly opposes aid going to Ukraine if you read his replies to people. This could be because Russia has lots of Nickel for example which he needs for his batteries.

63,1671741717.0,RealTesla,"""I hover my foot over the accelerator pedal in case the car brakes for no reason"" How have so many people become so crazy?","For years, I've heard some variation on this phrase pop up in every conversation about the shortcomings of Autopilot and FSD, both of which remain beset by phantom braking‚Äîthe car's tendency to abruptly slow down (or nearly stop, in extreme cases) for no reason. This problem has never been fixed, and even supposed improvements are subjective; even as some drivers report a reduction in the phenomenon, others report increases. To my knowledge, Tesla has never even attempted to officially explain the nature of phantom braking, nor have they offered a roadmap for when and how it will be solved. Considering it's literally a life-and-death issue, this strikes me as... odd.

The following is a direct quote from a recent post on the topic, but it's probably the hundredth time I've heard it. Again and again, people say this as if it's *not* fucking absurd:

&gt;I developed a habit of hovering my foot over the accelerator at all times and I just mash it as soon as it begins to phantom brake.

Allow me to propose a simpler solution: **if your car has a feature that causes it to unexpectedly slow down or stop,** ***never use that feature. Ever.***

You'd think this would be common sense, right? Amazingly, in the world of Tesla, you'd be wrong. Somehow, the idea that something so patently dangerous should be avoided at all costs never quite caught on. Instead, many Tesla owners decide the best course of action is to **keep using it**, thus *continually* rolling the dice and putting other drives at risk without their consent, and hope that their reflexes‚Äîseriously, their *reflexes*‚Äîwill solve a problem that *they themselves* have created by choosing to engage in a practice *they know is dangerous* again and again.

**Remember: it's no one else's problem that you paid for a feature that can't be used safely.** I'm sorry if you're disappointed or feel ripped off, but *no one else* has agreed to be in the proximity of your attempts at ""taming"" an unreliable form of automation while traveling at high speeds in a machine that weighs thousands of pounds. I don't want your next showdown with AI to unfold in front of my car, or the car of a friend or family member. I don't know you, I have no reason (nor obligation) to put my faith in your reaction time, and if you think this is a good idea in the first place, I already have reason to question your judgment.

**This isn't a fucking video game.** Phantom braking has been documented extensively. It's happened in my own M3P, and caused a near-accident that scared me straight immediately. No one questions whether this risk exists. The only question is whether you're going to behave like a responsible adult or continue to take chances you have no legal or moral right to take on public roads.

I'll conclude by returning to the question in the title of my post: how the fuck did people lose their minds so thoroughly? How did presumably rational people decide that they should continue to gamble with their safety, and the safety of others, with a randomly-braking ""feature""‚Äîand convince themselves that their own reflexes are a sufficient remedy?

I'm getting solar installed on my house sometime next year. We're still very much in the preliminary design stage so I'm trying to be sure I'm making the right decision. For my situation, they're suggesting a Tesla Powerwall 2 due to specific details of the system configuration. They've claimed the Tesla batteries are the best on the market and the best for taking advantage of net metering and time-of-use cost offset. I don't doubt that, but I have some concerns. 

On one hand, I feel like the batteries being joint between Tesla and Panasonic makes me less worried about quality issues related to their automobiles. On the other hand, who knows what's going to happen with this shitshow company so I worry about losing app access and/or functionality if they decide to be dicks or they go under.

Musk said the fully loaded rig weighed 37 tons at the launch event. It was only carrying 6 tons of concrete. A flat bed weighs between 5 and 10 tons at the absolute most. That means there is up to 25 tons to be accounted for. There is no way that that unit weighs 25 tons.

The only other explanation is that they faked the run. I already strongly suspect that this is the case since the truck in the video was clearly only carrying 6 tons. There is no reason to believe that the unit weighs any more than 12 tons. I suspect that they loaded up 25 tons and found that they couldn‚Äôt get anywhere close to the 500 miles they were aiming for, so they had to remove some of the cargo and do it again.

The trucking industry already struggles to find enough qualified truckers to fill its routes. If the reaction to electric semi specs from truckers Cowboy State Daily talked to is any indication, a ban on diesel trucks is likely to make the problem worse. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt want it. Don‚Äôt need it. No way,‚Äù said Buddy Holley of Missouri about electric semis. 

He drives 550 to 600 miles a day and said that if he had to stop every 400 miles to charge for a half hour, his days would get considerably longer. 

Holley said the laws in California regarding what roads trucks are allowed to drive on are so difficult, he avoids driving there at all. 

Roy Smith, a long-haul trucker from Baltimore, said it takes him five minutes to refuel now. He‚Äôs not keen on the idea of an extra 25 minutes per stop, as well as much more frequent stops. 

‚ÄúI sometimes do friggin‚Äô 800 miles in a day. Having to charge every 400, that‚Äôs just not efficient. No, that‚Äôs not good at all,‚Äù Smith said. 

‚ÄòAin‚Äôt Gonna Work‚Äô

Long-haul trucker Wayne Richmond of Meaford, Ontario, Canada, said the charging requirements for the Tesla Semi make it impractical for his own work. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Canadian driver, and my routes are 1,200 to 1,800 miles. Electric ain‚Äôt gonna work,‚Äù he said. 

The Canadian said that in Ontario, there are charging stations all along the highway that have sprung up in the past several years. 

‚ÄúIt blew me away,‚Äù Richmond said. 

In the United States, charging stations are a lot more scarce, especially in Wyoming. Assuming the Tesla Megachargers are as slow to appear across America‚Äôs highways, a sufficient network could be decades away. 

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see my boss going that way,‚Äù Richmond said about replacing diesel semis with electric. 

Ernie Navarrete, a trucker from El Paso, Texas, said he can refuel in about seven minutes. He‚Äôd have to charge twice a day in a Tesla Semi, which would add at least 46 minutes to his day. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a fan of them. Maybe in the future,‚Äù Navarrete said.",0.8,62.0,0.0,62.0,,2022-12-10T17:39:57Z,zhyf49,t3

286,1670426047.0,RealTesla,Tesla Homelink module next on the chopping block?,"I've seen more than a few posts about the upcoming ""Holiday Update"" including ""MyQ Garage Door Opener Support"". MyQ is a cloud-based portal/API that some Chamberlain/Liftmaster garage door openers support (They also sell a MyQ hub to make legacy/any garage door opener work with it). The hub/opener connects to your home Wifi and lets you control the opener via an app or api, and the hub talks to your opener via regular RF.

Adding support for internet-controlled garage door openers is probably a prelude to getting rid of the $300 Homelink module (which must be purchased and installed separately post-delivery).

I don't think this is a good thing, as there are some drawbacks to controlling a garage door opener via MyQ, such as:  
\* Requires internet access - both on the home side and from the Tesla side - so if either your home WiFi is down, or the Tesla LTE signal is bad, the opener will be uncontrollable.  
\* MyQ enabled garage door openers have a ""feature"" (which you cannot disable) such that when they are closed via a MyQ command, it first flashes the lights and emits a beeping sound for a period of time before closing (this is so that if you close it while not actually being there, anyone that is in the way will know it is about to close), so the closing is not instantaneous like it is when using an RF or homelink remote.  
\* Requires yet another cloud-based integration that you have to manage passwords for and that have potentials for security breaches.  
\* Latency - an RF/homelink remote signal is instant, using MyQ requires sending a request out to the internet, to the MyQ servers, and then to your MyQ opener/hub

Due to at least the things I mentioned plus some I probably didn't think of, there is pretty much ZERO advantage to controlling your garage door over the internet instead of via RF/Homelink, \*except\* it's one more piece of hardware that Tesla can remove, to make the car and accessories cheaper and reduce their supply chain issues, ironically while they continue to raise the price.

So, my guess is RIP Homelink soon, and it can join the graveyard of:

309,1670294191.0,RealTesla,Tesla Weight,"So I‚Äôm a trucker and I‚Äôm interested in the Tesla Semi just from the technological aspect.  I think it works in some areas but definitely not long distance.

I got bored and I was very interested in figuring the weight of the Semi.  Now this is going to be very rough estimates because there are many unknown variables but here we go.

Based off of the video where the semi is going up a mountain and accelerating (impressive) at max weight there are 11 jersey barriers on the flatbed.  Assuming that these are solid concrete barriers and not hollow each one weighs roughly 4,000lbs for a total of 44,000 pounds of cargo.  The weight of your average flatbed is roughly 7,000lbs.

82,000-44,000=38,000lbs empty with a flatbed.  

38,000-7,000=31,000lbs empty Tractor only.


Your average 53ft Dry van trailer weighs 14,000lbs-16,000lbs.  Let‚Äôs give Tesla the lower number.  31,000+14,000=45,000lbs total weight of your traditional Box Trailer attached to a Tesla Semi.

Now how much cargo capacity is left?  With the 2,000lb exemption we have a max allowable weight of 82,000lbs.

82,000-45,000=37,000lbs of allowable cargo capacity.

I own a 2016 Freightliner Cascadia and the max I can carry before being overweight with full diesel tanks is 46,000lbs.  

I created this just for reference or a guide.  I could be wrong but I welcome any constructive comments or criticisms.

449,1669332681.0,RealTesla,"PSA: You, the human driver, are always the fallback for FSD Beta!","I am going to try to keep this brief...

Since Tesla announced that FSD Beta is being released widely (which is always effectively was, but that is perhaps a topic for another time), I have noticed quite a few comments across various subs that mischaracterize the systems safety dynamics of this system.

I think the first thing to recognize is that FSD Beta, per Tesla's own ‚Äúfine print assertions‚Äù, is an automated vehicle that requires a human driver fallback ***at all times***.

That means that you, the human driver, are the ""safety net"" for FSD Beta at all times - not the other way around.

FSD Beta is never the safety net for you, the human driver.

As such, you, the human driver, are always driving the FSD Beta-active vehicle.

At no time is FSD Beta ""driving"" the vehicle.

That is way that Tesla has nominally designed this system.

Not to be too forward with it, but take it up with Tesla if you disagree with that.

That said, the basic issue here is that, fundamentally, Tesla's product names and marketing campaigns combined with recent statements during ""AI Day"" and recent statements by Ashok Elluswamy are intended to ***unofficially*** (eclipsing the fine print) pretend that FSD Beta is somehow ""better"" than a human driver without FSD Beta (even though, again, the human driver is always the system fallback by design).

The safety of these systems relies, again fundamentally, on the fragile psychological contract between an enormous pool of relative unsophisticated human drivers and the requirements of the engineered system.

(And it is because that this fragile contract must be maintained that I am personally skeptical that these system can ever enhance roadway safety from a practical standpoint.)

466,1669217551.0,RealTesla,What is the best theory of Tesla's high margins?,"I have a skew to TSLAQ, but I think this whole thing is way more complex than I understand, and I am open to changing my mind. Anyway, I was discussing with a friend about Tesla margins.

My basic framework of why they are so high is that:

* There is a significant demand for Teslas currently, so they keep hiking prices
* Elon Musk is a very excentric personality, so Tesla doesn't spend on marketing
* Tesla has no dealerships, so it can keep the profit
* They are likely some years ahead in terms of manufacturing capability
* Maybe they cut some corners with stuff they shouldn't
* They sell expensive high-end cars

The basic things I believe of why this will change in the future

* **Demand:** As they hike production and the installed capacity increases, eventually all the hardcore fans will own a Tesla, the waiting lines will shorten and they will have to sell to people who compare more. This will mean being more competitive with prices and possibly having inventory.
* **Advertising:** It is possible that if Tesla wanted to keep the company at its current size, they wouldn't need to spend on ads ever. But as they ramp up the company, they'll inevitably need to spend on ads. Also, Musk and Tesla are different entities, and Musk charges heavily for his personality (as he did with the 2018 plan), so maybe you need to pay recurring big bonuses for Musk to continue to be the face of the company. Also, there's the risk of Musk growing bored and focusing on his other stuff (philanthropy, SpaceX, Twitter, making kids) and no amount of money being enough to keep him.
* **Dealerships:** Here I don't understand completely. As far I understand, there's big regulatory capture here in many jurisdictions, particularly in the US, to keep the dealers. Also, it seems something that as the competition figures out how to get rid of the dealers, this will all become customer surplus. Maybe incumbents won't be able to figure out it, but maybe new competitors will (Rivian, Apple, Smartphone OEMs, Chinese OEMs...), because they also won't suffer from GM/F/STLA/VW innovator's dilemma.
* **Manufacturing capability:** Battery is a big piece of the car and it seems that if you call CATL/LG/Panasonic and buy some, they'll deliver. On the technology side, companies like Qualcomm and Mobileye are working to create one-stop shops on the technology. Even companies like Foxconn are working so that eventually we have fabless OEMs. One anecdote recurringly brought about Tesla's manufacturing acumen is the pressing machine. But the company that produces it is a small Italian company that doesn't have $1B in market cap. It's hard to believe that there's a moat in something like that. I am not saying that Tesla isn't ahead of the curve, just that this should inevitably erode.
* **Tesla cut corners:** Here the outcome should be that the Tesla brand erodes. I don't think this is happening, at least because of this.
* **High-end cars:** They will eventually need to go downmarket, just because the high-end market isn't that large. And these cheaper cars will be sold at a lower price and margins.

Another argument is that even if their automotive margins erode, people will pay $600/year for ADAS will make up for it over the long term. I don't know how to think about it. It causes me a significant surprise that Tesla sells ADAS software as a lump-sum payment these days instead of a subscription, something that basically no one does with software anymore. (I am kinda skeptical that they will achieve autonomy, but it seems to be a nice ADAS. But it seems to me it should be something that comes with the car, not a subscription. To compare, it would be like if Microsoft charged you a subscription if you wanted to use the internet when you buy a Windows.)

My Tesla sees the green car approaching and freaks the fuck out. Jams on the breaks. Red behind me has to break/swerve to avoid. Green car is confused, because they were expecting to merge behind behind blue and red.

I'll die on this hill. This behavior is both incorrect and incredibly dangerous. Merging traffic yields to traffic already on the road. Even if I didn't have the right of way (which I did), behaving predictably is better than being right. Always.

I've seen this error a half dozen times or more now. It is not a weird edge case. This shit has to change

https://news.mydrivers.com/1/873/873598.htm

&gt; While the Tesla brake-failure fatal crash in Chaozhou is still being investigated, another car owner revealed that he, too, experienced brake failure.
&gt; 
&gt; According to the owner, he was driving on an elevated highway facing a traffic jam and was driving very slowly at only 10‚Äì20 km/h. When he released the throttle, the vehicle not only did not slow down but slightly accelerated after applying the brakes, and the owner realized that something was wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; The vehicle's central control then displayed various alarms and fault codes, prompting the owner to pull over to the side and contact Tesla customer service.The customer service team rebooted the system remotely, trying to fix the issue, but the malfunction was not solved by the reboot, and the vehicle had to be towed away.
&gt; 
&gt; The owner asked the customer service representative whether the problem would occur again, but the customer service representative only gave a vague corporate response and refused to give a clear answer. In the meantime, the owner was given a replacement vehicle to take home while he waited for the testing results.
&gt; 
&gt; The Tesla repair report that was given to the owner after the incident said that the car did contain flaws. According to the investigation, ""the restraint control module was damaged, affecting other modules and causing the braking system to malfunction.""
&gt; 
&gt; A Tesla customer service representative later admitted that when the driver steps on the brakes, it will cause ""a slight speed boost"", which is ""similar to how a manual transmission vehicle will respond when its gearbox is put in neutral"". We cannot verify this claim as we have never driven the manual transmission vehicles described.
&gt; 
&gt; The Tesla representative also said that the owner could file a report with the aftermarket department, but the report would not be assessed by the company. The warranty guarantees that the electric vehicle will be repaired after a malfunction or incident, but Tesla does not promise that the vehicle will not fail again in the future.
&gt; 
&gt; And for the brake-causing speed boost, the Tesla representative answered, ""Step hard, do not be afraid, it will not spike up,"" but the owner said straight, he certainly will not dare to step hard on the brakes in the future.

But the fact is Twitter was also used by lots of people for actual useful purposes, staying in touch, reporting revolutions and govt oversight, and before Musk actually did try and be responsible.

And even if you think the world is better off with it gone, along with everyone it employed (who are no different from other big tech companies), its still 44 fucking billion dollars. A tiny fraction of that could alleviate hunger, poverty, misery for millions.

This is a complete shit show and the end result will be gutting a company that served a critical purpose for many, and an egomaniac asshole losing what he makes in \~2 years and posting more memes.

580,1668546986.0,RealTesla,LOTS of used Teslas at dealers - Ponzi scheme or known practice?,"Apologies if this has been discussed before... I've randomly passed two Tesla Dealerships in the last year and seen 40+ used Teslas parked in all sorts of ways on lots near the Tesla dealership but out of sight from the showroom. The two dealerships were located in Seattle WA (Sodo) and Mt Kisco NY (suburb of NYC). I am assuming these cars are used because there is no shrink wrapping on them and they are parked in a way that suggests that they will not be moved any time soon. For example, I saw loads of Teslas in Mt Kisco from the Metro North train, and they were parked single file between a building and a steel fence right next to the train track. Teslas everywhere, the grass growing long all around their tires. They were not damaged and look normal from the outside. In Sodo I witnessed something similar. Lots and lots of cars. 

Meanwhile, my Dad was on a long waitlist for the Model Y. How is it that there is a waitlist for new vehicles but a glut of used ones? Are the dealers discovering problems with older models which they cannot fix and offering trade-ins to customers? What kind of trade-in value are they offering on the used models?

642,1668283381.0,RealTesla,"So Long Tesla, Trading our MYP Today","Wanted to wish any Tesla owners/drivers good luck, but glad I‚Äôm able to get out from under what has become, in my personal view, a liability. Took delivery last October (2021) and had a great experience all the way through the purchase and delivery process. Overall, have been pretty happy with the product, but admittedly was never interested in FSD; used it like a normal vehicle all the way through. There‚Äôs really much to like enjoy about Teslas, from the fantastic and regularly updated interface, the minimalist interior design, the frunk, no keys, etc and etc.  
It wasn‚Äôt all fun and happiness though. The service experience leaves much to be desired; so much so that I‚Äôve found myself becoming worried about the headaches of having to get anything repaired. I only have had to replace the windshield, and what should have been an easy install turned into enough of a headache to make me not want to return. There‚Äôs next to zero communication leading up to appointments, service center will not reply to messages and even deletes messages. Only way to speak to anyone is to show up for an appointment and even then it‚Äôs excuse after excuse and arguments to get any sort of standard service.  
The tipping point, for my family at least, has been witnessing the absolute brashness of Elon‚Äôs ego throughout this whole Twitter debacle. I now have zero faith that any company he is at the helm of does anything to customer benefit. Suddenly, my experience with Tesla doesn‚Äôt feel limited to a poorly operated service center, but instead I can clearly see that policy changes (Uber credits/loaners, cxl appointment fees, QA issues, etc) appear so anti-customer because the customer isn‚Äôt even part of the equation. We‚Äôre afterthoughts. All the documented instances of Tesla cutting corners at the detriment of the customer makes so much more sense now. For the sake of anyone who remains an owner or chooses to become one in the future, I sincerely hope things improve, but I‚Äôm not confident they will.  
Through the process of finding a trade, we‚Äôre already learning that the value that was in the car just a few months ago has negatively been impacted by the public idiocy of Musk, manifested by increased trade-ins and less demand. Maybe that will balance out once this chapter for Musk blows over, but I‚Äôm not sticking around to see. I‚Äôve never purchased the same make of car twice, but only one make I will say I will likely never return to- Tesla; barring any serious overhaul to QC, service, and the outcome of current federal investigations. All things considered, it was a lukewarm experience and the positives no longer outweigh the negatives. Some things will be missed/remembered fondly, but expecting the bigger manufacturers to catch up on those aspects quickly. It‚Äôs mostly sad because this could have been a great experience. Looking forward to my new Volvo electric in a few hours. Bye for probably forever!",0.8,147.0,0.0,147.0,,2022-11-12T20:03:01Z,ytgvv3,t3

652,1668222796.0,RealTesla,Is there a used Tesla speculation-style bubble about to burst?,"I am in the Canadian Praires and I went to look at a used 7-seater MY cause there is no Tesla showroom in my area. while chatting with the used car manager he mentioned how Teslas are being offered to his dealership by individuals who speculatively bought multiple units for immediate resale. (And apparently dealers themselves were ordering them in batches)

So dealers in my area of central canada have 2021 and 2022 MY amd M3 for sale for anywhere from the current new price to new price plus $10,000. Now i understand that price bump when wait times really were 1-yr plus but thats no longer the case, a M3 is mere weeks away and MY seems to be 1-2 months. (multiple ads for the ‚Äúused‚Äù car with 100km on it still advertise ‚Äúskip the  year wait‚Äù). Anecdotally, ads seem to be piling up and there seems to be lots of ‚Äúthis weekend only‚Äù sales going on.

So, is there a point when customers wise up to this and lots are left filled with very lightly used overpriced m3s and MYs?

On top of that, interest rates are not working in favor of an $80,000+CAD automobile.

For FYI, I had an order for a MY7 that i was supposed to pick up this weekend but had never seen the car in-person. When my wife saw the actual size of the rear seat we canceled the pickup and are re-evaluating our options. So, Now I am holding back and might wait a few months to see what the used scene shakes out. I like the M3 and MY but my spidey sense tells me better deals might be coming down the line in the used market.

This is the third discount offered in two months. 

https://insideevs.com/news/620909/tesla-giga-shanghai-ev-inventory/amp/

Discounts tend to reduce demand rather than boost it. As prospective buyers observe these pattern of discounts, they tend to hold out for more discounts. Also, the one brand that‚Äôs discounting projects an image of inferior value. Tesla is one of if not the only major brand discounting in China.

The majority of profit and vast majority of growth are generated by Tesla Shanghai. Weakness there will result in a very ugly Q4 earnings. Forget Twitter nonsense. Tesla is at risk of a sequential fall in profit if Shanghai profits weakens further. Another price cut there is somewhat likely.

Furthermore, Q3 earnings did not prepare investors for Q4. When asked about demand weakness, Elon pretended not to hear the question. Rather than offering guidance, he offered a general target for next five years of 50%. If there‚Äôs any slow down, he can say the next year can make up for it. We know why now. Elon needed to sell more stocks. A honest preview of Q4 and China situations may tank the stock.",0.96,131.0,0.0,131.0,,2022-11-11T03:48:57Z,ys0dhv,t3

682,1668089952.0,RealTesla,FSD Beta and Dangerous J3016 Myths,"# Part 9

One of newer myths that has emerged this year with respect to the FSD Beta program and Tesla is one in which the [SAE J3016 standard](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j3016_202104/) is distorted in various ways.

While J3016 has numerous issues in practice (and dangerous issues through consumer marketing), a perplexing line of attack of the standard is to recast it as one in which ""the levels"" represent the (legal, presumably) liability that the manufacturer of an automated driving system is currently willing to accept on itself.

For example, these myths (\*) are common expressed on Twitter and Reddit:

&gt;FSD Beta is currently at Level 3 (or higher), but Tesla just does not want to accept liability for anything higher than Level 2 at the moment. So, FSD Beta is at Level 2.

or

&gt;A Level 5 robotaxi becomes a Level 2 system if the manufacturer places liability on the human driver.

Let us break this down a bit because there is some circular logic in these myths, combined with a lack of knowledge around systems safety realities.

First off, if you have not reviewed it already, I would highly recommend the [SAE J3016 User Guide](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/j3016/) written and maintained by Professor Phil Koopman of Carnegie Mellon University (\*\*). Professor Koopman is an expert at systems safety and has been studying automated driving systems/vehicles for decades.

If one were to observe the very first table of that user guide, one might recognize that the J3016 standard, at its core, is a (very) basic taxonomy of system ***capabilities*** (or features) - and that the capabilities/features of the engineered system increase in number as the numerical level designation is larger in value.

What the J3016 standard is not is a safety standard. The J3016 standard does not offer any processes in verifying and validating these systems, any technology choice prescriptions as it would pertain to the whole system or hard definitions on any systems safety metrics.

The concept of ""liability"" is also not treated in the standard.

Various interpretations of how (human driver) liability ***may*** be shaped by the manufacturer at various capability levels can be ***inferred*** from the standard - but those inferences would be entirely subjective (\*\*\*).

So, that basically puts what the J3016 is and is not on the table.

From what has already been written, these myths are effectively dispelled. There are no objective links between the J3016 standard and liability.

But let us dive a down a bit deeper into the systems safety aspects of this.

What is also implied in those myths is that Tesla has ""achieved"" or ""solved"" a certain level of capabilities in FSD Beta-equipped/active vehicles ***today***, but the true extent of the achievement is not known to outside observers for various reasons.

Per various statements by Musk over the years, those reasons have long included nebulous regulatory roadblocks, but now an additional reason has been added in that Tesla just does not want to accept liability at the moment.

The first issue with this implication is something that I addressed in a previous dedicated post, which I invite you to review if you have the time:

[The Myth of ""Solving"" FSD](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/comments/w2qlt1/the_myth_of_solving_fsd/)

In that post, I expounded upon the reasons why there is no bright ""finish line"" associated with safety-critical systems and the economic realities of continuous, never-ending validation that such systems must undergo.

The inclusion of the economic considerations was intentional because, here, they speak to the fact that initial and continuous validation allows businesses to concretely quantify the business risk associated with their systems.

If a certain automated vehicle has a ***design intent*** targeting J3016 Level 4-capabilities (where the system limitations do not include a human driver fallback), then it only makes economic sense to validate said system within the full spectrum of capabilities associated with that level, at minimum.

The validation costs increase substantially as the capabilities increase per J3016 (but so does the payoff, hopefully) so it makes no sense for a manufacturer to hold capabilities back since offering those capabilities was the whole point of paying enormously into the validation in the first place!

One cannot practically detach validation from liability.

That addresses the second part of dispelling the above myths - basically rendering them immediately moot, in fact.

Here is what I think is the motivation for these myths.

I believe that certain ardent Tesla supporters have grown increasingly frustrated by outside comparisons of FSD Beta-equipped Tesla vehicles (nominally, a Level 2-capable vehicle once active) to other efforts more generally defined as pursuing Level 4-capable vehicles. Then, we also have unfavorable comparisons between Mercedes' DrivePILOT product that has received some measure of Level 3-feature certifications in the EU while the FSD Beta product is not even offered in the EU market.

By constructing the above myths, it takes the technical burden off of Tesla in offering a system of more capabilities and effectively attempts to recast it as ""Tesla's choice"".

The risk here is that these myths further perpetuate [\#autonowashing](https://lizadixon.com/Autonowashing) in those that currently use the FSD Beta product - it implies that higher automated capabilities are there (less limitations), just underneath the surface, so driver attentiveness is not strictly necessary at all times.

That is why these myths are ultimately dangerous.

(\*) There is also a relatively popular myth that has recently emerged that claims that Waymo (or other shadowy ""competitors"" with Tesla) explicitly designed the J3016 standard solely for their purposes - somehow at the expense of Tesla's efforts. I am going to ignore that myth in this post as it is pretty absurd given that the J3016 standard is wide open on pretty much everything.

(\*\*) That J3016 User Guide, in fact, will address other lesser issues associated with these myths that I do not address in this post.

(\*\*\*) Clearly also, the J3016 standard cannot practically discuss liability because different jurisdictions may mandate manufacturer liability in certain ways (according to their various, local laws and legal frameworks) that are entirely independent of any intentional standard that would exist.

The interest from all the banks and creditors he took out to fund half of this deal has to be astronomical every year., To counteract that interest I have to imagine he's going to have to keep dipping into his Tesla stock to pay it off. I think three scenarios present themselves. 1. the leniency on moderation on the platform drives away advertisers and he ends up trying to turn Twitter into a subscription-only service which kills the platform. 2. To avoid the shit ton of interest on his loans he sells twitter at a dramatically lower price than what he paid which covers what the creditors gave him. 3. He has to continuously take money out of his tesla stock and eventually closes down Twitter and goes into bankruptcy. I have no clue how feasible that last part is because then he has to divest all of his assets.,0.82,46.0,0.0,46.0,shit,2022-11-04T04:25:28Z,yloq8x,t3

784,1667426497.0,RealTesla,The future of service,"Hi everybody! &lt;doctor-nick.gif&gt;

So, things have got pretty nuts this week, but I figured I'd put a couple thoughts together on what the possible future for Tesla service could be given Musk's recent spending spree.

First, I think the latest info says that Musk would have to use all the $20B he sold of TSLA this year, plus around $3B more to cover the funding gap between the debt and equity financing. So we'll call it $23B worth of TSLA just for the purchase, plus whatever's needed for taxes. Assuming 20% effective tax rate, that's probably a total TSLA sale of $29-30B.

Now, what could Tesla the company have done with that $30B instead of paying it out in cash? If we assume they could secure commercial leases for an average $13.95/sq ft/year, and each place would be around 25,000 sq ft, they could have paid 10 years of leases for 8600 new locations. This doesn't include any increases on the cash they had to pay out, so these are really conservative numbers. And industrial lease space averages around $10/sq ft so even those numbers are way in favor of Tesla.

Given the fact that owners have complained since the Model S started selling, and Elon started promising that he personally would address the service availability issues since around that time, it seems like the final nail is in that coffin. He has taken the money Tesla could have invested into improving their service offerings and locations, and sunk it into a vanity project for himself. IMO, this means he's shown irrefutable proof that he _does not_ care about Tesla customers and only cares about himself. I don't blame him for caring about himself more than anybody else, I'm the exact same way. I just don't promise anybody that I'll change.

Now consider the facts everybody's talking about- Splitting his time between 4 companies, getting employees from one company to do work for another company, mounting legal pressures and investigations, product delays from every company he's involved in... At some point, I feel like shareholders have to accept he's not in the game anymore, he's off his meds, he's leaning into his manic episodes, and everything he's touched lately has turned to shit. They either need to reel him back in, or cut him loose entirely. The True Believers won't, of course, but they need to if they don't want to be the butt of every joke. Tesla can turn their story around, make customers happy, and grow to be the brand that the cult wants it to be. But with Elon pulling this nonsense constantly, I just don't see how that ever happens.

Edit: Yes, I know how stock works, please don't try to explain it to me. As I've said below in comments, if there was $30B of demand for shares on the open market, Tesla could have stripped those people of that money and used it to improve service. Those shares were part of a compensation package, which _does_ sit on Tesla's financial tables. There's a million ways Elon drilled Tesla for money, I didn't think I'd need to get into the pedantry of all this in this sub.",0.85,26.0,0.0,26.0,,2022-11-02T22:01:37Z,ykj26y,t3

The OTA update that switched all cars, even radar-equipped ones, to vision is a particular sticking point of mine. I think Hyundai/Kia and Polestar are making better cars right now. 

With that said, Teslas are the only practical EV for a lot of people, thanks solely to the supercharging network. I live in a rural area, and the only reason I can make some of the trips I regularly have to make is because of superchargers. Other networks like EA and Chargepoint are fantastic when they work, but they‚Äôre not as widespread as superchargers, they‚Äôre much slower than superchargers, and (in my experience) they‚Äôre much less reliable. 

**Data (US only) pulled from manufacturer sites:**

EA: 791 stations, 4 stalls/station, 50kw minimum

Tesla: ~1240 stations, usually 8-12 stalls/station, 120kw minimum

Tesla is far from perfect. But the biggest problem consumers have in switching from ICE to EV is range/charging, and Tesla is (unfortunately) the only manufacturer with a practical solution to that problem right now.

885,1666544393.0,RealTesla,The elon musk show discussion?,"Just watched the first two episodes, and it showed a lot of sides of Elon. Basically he was horrible to everybody, including to himself, and he know it. But surprisingly he managed to motivate people and himself, again and again. 

The many production hell we suspected also seems to be true. The same case with the announcements of stuff on Twitter with the staff not knowing anything about it and face palmed how to make the tweet into reality.

Multiple people also confirmed that Elon does fire people on the spot, and do witch hunts. 

Even when the suspected witch turns out was just a normal worker that was not at fault, and their boss has explained to elon that it was their fault as boss (executive decision), not the worker... Elon still blame the worker. 

Then the suspicion of Elon is being surrounded by ""yes man"" was basically confirmed too. Multiple people explains that Elon will do meetings, and when there are people that are not positive with the direction, they will not be invited in the next meeting. 

Things also can quickly become personal to him, with strong feelings/emotions. Resulting into all kinds of emotions, from sadness, celebrations, to tantrums.

917,1666296063.0,RealTesla,Cancelled my Cybertruck order after my recent experience with new Model Y Performance,"We made the mistake of taking delivery of a Model Y performance on the last day of the quarter in June 2022.  The build quality does not even compare to a $20K Honda or Toyota and there are squeaks and rattles everywhere.  Body panels did not line up and the paint had a heavy orange-peel texture.

We were offered home delivery and the delivery team parked the car in the middle of my driveway and  told me they no longer had access to the vehicle and that I could not open it until I accepted delivery in the app.  I pointed out the obvious panel gap and misaligned tail lights and paint quality which they assured me would all be taken care of under warranty.  When I took the vehicle to the service center they balked at doing anything for the paint, did the bare minimum adjustments on the panels and would not touch the tail light saying it was ""within spec"".  We also discovered a deep gash in the back of the passenger front seat which they tried to claim that we had done but finally agreed to replace the seat back.

The car is back in the shop as it has squeaks and rattles coming from every direction.  Tesla tried to quote me their ""policy"" that squeaks and rattles are not covered under warranty and suggested that there would be a diagnostic fee.  I explained my delivery experience and they changed their tune a bit but it is still frustrating to pay $76K for a car and have so many issues.  The latest software update has made autopilot unusable as the high beams are forced on as soon as you engage and they do not properly auto-dim.  Tesla continues to take away features such as Ultrasonic sensors but their ADAS features continue to get worse, not better.

It was an easy decision to cancel my Cybertruck today as dealing with Tesla has been an exercise in frustration.  They don't have any easy way to order parts and service now hides behind the app and will just quote high prices or close your request if they don't want to help.  I'm planning on replacing my gas F150 with a Hybrid or EV truck in the next several years but it definitely will not be a Cybertruck.  I hope that Tesla improves their build quality and service as they are alienating a lot of their user base.",0.86,320.0,0.0,320.0,,2022-10-20T20:01:03Z,y98ayn,t3

37,1671592607.0,teslamotors,Apple Music on Tesla appears to use the HE-AAC codec at 64 kbps. Explanation and testing inside.,"I got off my arse and did some very simple testing. It is my opinion that Apple is using the HE-AAC codec at 64 kbps when streaming Apple Music via the Tesla UI. My testing methodology and results are below.

##Methodology

* iPhone 14 mobile hotspot
* [Hotspot Monitor Data Usage](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hotspot-monitor-data-usage/id1037580658) from the Apple app store, to monitor data traffic.
* 2019 Model 3 on 2022.44.25.1 (we also have a 2021 Model Y on 2022.44.25.3 but I haven't seen an indication that bitrates were adjusted between these versions)

From there, I would monitor the data usage of the car while streaming music. I would match the data usage per song up to Apple's claims to see which codec is likely being used. [Per the Apple Music settings, it says (for a three minute song):](https://imgur.com/a/gRt5Qib)

* 1.5MB for HE-AAC (64k)
* 6MBfor AAC (256k)
* 36MB for Lossless (ALAC)
* 145MB for Hi-Res Lossless (24-bit/192kHz)

##Results

Through multiple songs I observed the same pattern - A burst of data as the next track began, then a trickle of data throughout the song. It appears to buffer most or even all of the song, then pause between tracks to do it again. On average, I saw ~2MB per track, with ~1.7MB during the initial burst and ~0.3MB throughout the track. This is consistent with the HE-AAC standard, as most of these songs were a little over 3 minutes in length.

This leads me to believe that Apple is using their HE-AAC codec at 64 kbps.

##Possible Questions/Concerns

(I'll update this with good questions from the comments)

**Q: How can you be certain that Apple is using HE-AAC and not another codec?**  
**A:** I can't be certain, but it's a reasonable guess. Apple uses very specific codecs for their 4 quality settings for Apple Music. Tesla's UI streams via Apple Music. It would be highly unlikely for Apple to make a codec unique to this one specific application given the size of their catalog. ~~That said, it's certainly possible that they have a hidden lower setting (32 kbps?) for embedded applications such as this.~~See the last question.

**Q: Could they be using a higher bitrate over LTE?**  
**A:** Not likely. There is no benefit to nerfing the bitrate over Wifi compared to LTE. There is benefit to nerfing it over LTE, as Tesla bulk buys data for their premium connectivity subscribers, and the incentive is to get as much out of it as possible while using as little as possible.

**Q: Ok, but why does it sound so much better to me?**  
**A:** 1) You're in a car, not an isolated and quiet listening environment. It's virtually impossible to tell the different between high quality lossy and lossless compression in such an environment. Secondly, [multiple listening tests (notes 10-13)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Efficiency_Advanced_Audio_Coding#cite_note-10) have shown that users cannot tell the difference between HE-AAC at 64 kbps, and MP3 via a high quality encoder at 128 kbps, even in isolated environments. Both Apple and Tesla likely felt that this was ""good enough"" for automotive use, and Tesla has incentive to minimize data consumption for their premium connectivity.

**Q: Would it be better for me to stream over Bluetooth? And if so, should I use high-quality (256 kbps AAC) or lossless?**  
**A:** 1) Premium connectivity is a convenience that you pay for. Using Apple Music over BT will yield higher sound quality and, if that's the only reason you had premium connectivity, it will save you money. 2) If you use high-quality (AAC 256 kbps), it will play back using AAC over BT, so you should lose no additional quality going from phone to car. If you use lossless, there is debate if it would transcode to AAC or SBC. Best case, you're introducing a non-zero amount of additional battery drain for no benefit (AAC), worst-case is you get SBC and it sounds slightly worse. Use High Quality.

**Q: Is it a Tesla, AT&amp;T, or Apple limitation that we can't have offline storage and higher bitrates?**  
**A:** Of the three, my personal bet is on Apple limiting the choices, and Tesla choosing the lower of the two, but this is highly speculative. But I'll try to source it. Apple allows for the embedding of Apple Music via JavaScript. Tesla uses JavaScript for much of their UI and app interfaces. So it's a safe bet that Tesla is pulling from that.

&amp;#x200B;

 

(Reuters) - Tesla is developing a revamped version of Model 3, according to four people with knowledge of the effort, as the top EV maker aims to cut production costs and boost the appeal of the five-year-old electric sedan.

One focus of the redesign codenamed ""Highland"" is to reduce the number of components and complexity in the interior of the Model 3 while focusing on features that Tesla buyers value, including the display, according to the people, who asked not to be named because the revamp has not been announced.

The previously unreported redesign comes as the electric sedan faces increased competition from models from the likes of China's BYD, Hyundai and coming releases from other major automakers.

The revamp of the battery-powered sedan, which could also include some changes to the Model 3's exterior and powertrain performance, will go into production at Tesla's factory in Shanghai and the company's Fremont, California plant, two of the people said. Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory will put the redesigned Model 3 into production in the third quarter of 2023, they said.

It was not clear when production would start at the Fremont plant or how large a cost savings Tesla would achieve from the redesign as it works with suppliers.

The effort spotlights an approach to vehicle development pioneered by Tesla and now being copied by other automakers, including Toyota Motor, that removes complexity - and cost - in production.

It is also an example of a key project at Tesla that has rolled ahead even as Chief Executive Elon Musk has focused on his troubled acquisition of Twitter in recent months, an area of concern for Tesla investors.

Tesla did not respond to a written request for comment from Reuters.

CHANGE YOU CAN SEE

The redesign for the Model 3 builds on the revamp of the Model S -- Tesla's premium EV sedan -- that was released last year. That redesign added an airplane-style yoke in place of a traditional steering wheel and removed buttons and traditional air vents as part of a minimalist interior where the centerpiece is a 17-inch electronic display.

The Model 3, Tesla's cheapest EV starting at just under $47,000 in the United States, had been the automaker's best-seller but is being overtaken by the Model Y crossover. With only four models in production, styling changes to any part of Tesla's lineup carry an outsized importance compared to established automakers.

Ed Kim, president of AutoPacific Group, which tracks market trends and production, said the current Model 3 has already been updated from the version that first went on sale in 2017 because of the way Tesla updates battery performance, information and entertainment options through software, even if it still looks the same.

""Having said that, consumers still tend to equate visual changes with newness,"" he said. ""Tesla knows visually tangible changes are in order.""

""The upcoming changes that potential customers can see and feel will be very important in ensuring that EV customers still have Tesla at the top of their minds as truly excellent alternatives to Tesla are starting to flood the market,"" he said.

KEEP IT SIMPLE

Musk has pushed a simplified approach to design and production at Tesla that the Highland project extends, said the people with knowledge of the development.

Tesla has pioneered the use of massive casting machines known as Giga Press and built by IDRA Group in Italy to make single, larger pieces of a vehicle in assembly, reducing cost and speeding production. It has also designed a structural battery pack that does away with more expensive modules.

Musk has said Tesla is looking to drive costs down through simplification and working on a small-car platform that would be half the cost of the Model 3.

""Over and over, we found parts that are not needed. They were put in there just in case or by mistake. We eliminated so many parts from a car that did nothing,"" Musk said in an interview at a Baron Funds conference earlier in the month.

The approach is part of what has made Tesla the most profitable electric vehicle maker while many rivals are still running at a loss. In the third quarter, Tesla made a profit of just over $9,500 for every car sold, compared to roughly $1,300 for Toyota, according to disclosures by both companies.

The revamp of the Model 3 comes at a time when sales in China, its second-largest market after the United States, are under pressure. Sales for the Model 3 in China fell 9% in the first ten months from a year earlier, while BYD's Qin and Han electric sedans outsold the Model 3, according to China Passenger Car Association.

To boost sales, Tesla cut prices for Model 3 and Model Y in China by as much as 9% in October and offered an additional rebate for buyers who took immediate delivery.

Sam Fiorani, who tracks Tesla and industry-wide production at Auto Forecast Solutions, said the upcoming changes to the Model 3, which he understood were coming, showed the power of Tesla's approach in taking out complexity.

""They are always looking for ways to make EVs profitable, and more profitable,"" he said.

We've had yet more failures with our system (2AM woken up by our UPS systems beeping due to low battery, due to powerwall 10  min crash+-)  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRjzyXaEuyg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRjzyXaEuyg)

I'm here to provide yet another milestone update, our install was signed off by Tesla, approved as a 10 powerwall off-grid install which by all accounts should work 24/7 unless we either drain the batteries to 0% or there is a system failure.  


Tesla has acknowledged for the past 18 months there is a warranty issue at hand and have occasionally every 2-6 months applied a firmware update advising that there was a change to address our issue, on each account it has failed.  


Our most recent firmware update was done two days ago which was supposed to take less than an hour, ended up having over 50 powercycles, failures during update process destroying our powered gate transformer, we have had pool pumps, air con fans, pc's break due to the frequent power cycles.  


We're still awaiting compensation after asking numerous times for such and expressing severe disappointment with the system.  


After 18 months of perpetual issues with our off-grid install (hundreds of crashes, multiple firmware revisions) we are now striving for a full system-refund and removal, or we'll be finally taking Tesla to court in Australia.  


Gdnight, it's 2:30 now downunder and I should try get back to sleep

Range - Huge win. I went from 270 to 340 miles, and faster charging. Add it all up and charging stops are about half as long as they used to be on road trips, since you can stay under 60 percent easier. Great!

Interior quality - Good improvement. Nicer materials. Everything is just a touch better. Still a small step down compared to my Genesis GV80, but it's fighting in the right league now.

Speed - Noticeably faster, even without plaid. Teslas are very fun to drive, and the refresh is better. 

Autopilot - Draw to slightly worse. I don't have the phantom braking issues I was expecting, and some parts work better, but there are a lot of small new bugs as well. Stop and go traffic, one of my biggest priorities, is worse as it slams on the brakes when someone 20 feet ahead slows down. I have to wonder if this is because they axed the radar. It ends up being slightly dangerous in city highway traffic jams. 

Controls - Disappointingly a little worse. No stalks, the yoke looks cool but isn't as functional, I'm tired of the button turn signals, I honk when turning on autopilot once a week, etc. These are just unforced errors, and while none are as bad as I feared, they are absolutely a small step back from a normal car.

Audio - Neutral. Was hoping for something a bit better, but no biggie.

Rear seat screen - It exists. Not really sure why it's there, or why there's a powerful GPU. Please give me more range instead. Kids don't really watch it because it's strangely positioned.

Suspension - A bit better. Again, not bad, but not as good as the GV80.

360 surround view - how is this still not a feature?

7 seat vs 6 seat - 3 wide second row is great if you have 3 kids. 3rd row is worse, but if you can use it a lot less, 7 seats is the way to go. Plus you get extra cargo space most of the time. 

Overall - Neutral to a bit better. I buy Teslas because they're the best car experience. I think that's still the case this year, but after seeing their trajectory and what others are doing (I'm looking at you Volvo EX90), I don't think they'll be the best next year. I'm surprised that 4 years of development and a refresh didn't really raise the bar. It's like a minor refresh.

323,1668502335.0,teslamotors,Model Y - Emergency Lane Departure giving me anxiety,"Hi All,

I did a quick search on this r/ before posting. Does the Emergency Lane Departure warning blast overly loud and wildly over sensitive?

I've asked tesla support why I can't permanently disable it. Apparently due to legislation? but every other car I've driven you can turn off those systems.

It wouldn't be so bad, but in Australia, motorbikes are allowed to lane spit and you'd regularly have bikes flying down the white lane markers between cars. If I stayed exactly in the middle of the lane, I'd get clipped by a motorbike. 

It's also very sensitive to when you'd move to 'kiss' the apex of corners when flowing with the camber of the roads or narrow streets where local council put a pedestrian island literally in the lane. You have to run on the white line opposite not to hit it. And the car yells at me again.

It wouldn't be so bad if I could turn down the volume of the alert. But it's like someone setting off a siren in the car 6 times a day to and from work. It's giving me PTSD like I've missed something important. Turns out it just didn't like being 12inches from a white line.... 

I know I can turn if off, but it turns right back on again next time you engage drive. I'm not sure how much more of this thing yelling at me I can handle.  
It doesn't look like there's been any improvement, change or conversation about it in a couple years on reddit? Is that the case? or am I being silly?",0.49,0.0,0.0,0.0,,2022-11-15T08:52:15Z,yvrdfg,t3

3,1672047778.0,mercedes_benz,I bought a used 2018 GLC 300 in 2022: 6 Month Review,"I bought a used 2018 GLC 300 4matic about 6 months ago with 63k miles. I absolutely love the car, it's been a joy to drive and comfortable. Here are some pros and cons so far:

Pros:

\-I love that the car does not use a touch screen like a lot of modern cars, and the ac/heat controls still have physical buttons. 

\-The infotainment center works great, and I find it to be better than most cars. I do not have the touchpad, just the joystick dial. I much prefer the dial as it make it easy to navigate the screen while driving. 

\-Driving is mostly smooth, no vibrations in the steering wheel. Corners feel great, brakes and gas pedal feel responsive but not overly touchy/jerky. 

\-The interior is flashy, I have espressro brown seats with the upgraded mb-tex material and stitching along the dash and window sills. Black ashwood trim mixed with the espresso brown looks unique. 

\-The car has plenty of power for maneuvering in traffic, gets decent mpg for this class of vehicle. 

\-Cup holders and storage galore.

Cons:

\-The base speakers are just ok, nothing special. 

\-The shifting between the 2nd and 3rd gear is noticeable, however everything else is butter smooth.

\-Halogen headlights that make the car look dated, also not the best visibility unless I turn the brights on.

\-Some of the plastic on the vehicle's interior and exterior (grill area) can feel tacky and cheap. The brushed aluminum on the dials and buttons does feel nice and premium so that makes up for it. 

\-Not a fan of the runflat tires as the ride could be smoother over bumps. I may switch to regular tires to see if there is a difference. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, the past 6 months have been great. I did one oil change ($120), rear brakes/rotors replaced ($750). I also had my independent shop turn off the auto start/stop function that shuts off the engine at stoplights etc. so I no longer have to manually shut it off every time I start the vehicle. I would highly recommend this vehicle, it brings me great joy.

60,1671908429.0,mercedes_benz,Is Mercedes just not making the A250e at the moment due to the semiconductor shortage? (UK),"Alright so if you're also in the UK you might be familiar with the government company car programme that gives you a nice discount and tax break on company cars that are either EVs or plugin hybrids.

When I first checked it out through my company just over a year ago the Mercedes A250e was available to me on a lease of around ¬£300 which includes insurance, servicing, roadside assistance, the lot. Absolute no brainer.

Now I'm making real plans to move out of London I actually will need a car so I went to look at sorting an A250e but it wasn't on the website. Spoke to them (that is, the company my employer contracted to handle these EV leases) on the phone and they told me they have no idea when it or any comparable cars will be available again due to the semiconductor shortage.

I have read that the semiconductor shortage has hit the auto industry hardest, but I'm curious if this is a direct issue with Merc or if it's just an issue with the company my employer is using to acquire cars for this scheme?

In other words, anyone here able to buy the A250e brand new or you getting delays and similar issues even from Mercedes themselves?

Unfortunately the only other options currently available are budget cars with very short range or high end ones like the BMW i4 which I actually really like but the lease on that would be over double at ¬£670 a month - plus, I actually know someone who ordered one direct from BMW a while ago and he tells me the delivery date keeps getting pushed back.

And yes I asked about the BMW i3 as well, they told me it's in the same category as the A250e and again they have no idea when they'll be able to get those cars again, pinning the blame on the semiconductor shortage.

Just curious if anyone can chime in with experiences around any of this. Same as me, or able to order but getting delays, or anyone put in an order and getting no problems?

I wouldn't mind just buying a used car of course, but the tax advantages of the company car scheme and the fact insurance, servicing, breakdown cover is all included in the lease feels like I'd be leaving money on the table if I didn't take advantage of it.

88,1671817061.0,mercedes_benz,My next car will definitely be Mercedes Benz,"TW: talking about suicide attempt and depression

I was a proud owner of a 20 year old W168 (A170 CDI) and I loved the car with my entire soul. For me, it had a specific charm and a beautiful character. I loved it a whole lot. Sadly I had to say goodbye to it yesterday due to my mental health issues and depression I‚Äôve been dealing with for a while getting out of hand. Let me explain:
Yesterday I hit a hard low in my life and wanted to end it all, so I had an accident, on purpose. I luckily didn‚Äôt injure anyone else as that‚Äôs the last thing I wanted to do is to take someone with me, but Squeaky (a nickname I gave the car after it‚Äôs squeaking interior when I bought it) didn‚Äôt make it and is now totaled.
Now why do I share it here with you people? Because I walked away with only few bruises when I crashed at excess of 120kmph (according to the police) to a concrete wall. I don‚Äôt know how I made it, but I believe that it‚Äôs because of how safe the car was and how amazing the design is. It saved my life even when I didn‚Äôt want it to and gave me a second chance at lifr.
For me;
I‚Äôm being treated for my depression right now. As far as I‚Äôm aware I won‚Äôt lose my license or face any lawsuits, as this is a special case, but I will follow a recommendation from my psychiatrist to not drive until I feel better and have been treated for a while.
But the title still stands: In honor of Squeaky, my next car will be Mercedes, I‚Äôm not sure which one exactly right now, but it will definitely be a Mercedes. The brand earned my loyalty for the rest of my life.

Please drive carefully people and don‚Äôt do anything stupid in case you feel down. It‚Äôs genuinely not worth it, you might lose a friend in the process, even if it‚Äôs a car.

TL,DR: 20 year old W168 saved my life during a suicide attempt and it made me loyal to the brand for the rest of my life.",0.44,0.0,0.0,0.0,,2022-12-23T17:37:41Z,ztnk5e,t3

I have decided to get rid of the F30 BMW and look for a more reliable German car, and I was offered a 1980 Mercedes 300D for $9,000. The car has no rust on the body or on the underside, runs and drives well, and has working AC. It has 190,000 miles on the Odometer.

After the pre-purchase exam, the mechanic confirmed that the car‚Äôs engine, transmission, timing chain, and vacuum system is healthy. The 5 cylinder diesel runs strong with zero blow-by. Fuel filters, shocks, and ball joints have been changed, and a new aftermarket stereo is put in. There is a bit of an oil leak at the back of the valve cover and at the oil pan, but nothing major. The tires are in rough shape, but the seller is offering to put new tires on for free. The central locking does work from inside the car, but it cannot be locked from the outside. The mechanic quoted me $800 to redo the valve cover and oil pan gasket. 

I am almost ready to pull the trigger, but I have to ask: is the Mercedes 300D really as reliable as everyone makes it out to be? What is the cost for routine maintenance and repairs, and how often is small/large repairs needed? Is this a reliable car that will work well as a daily driver, or is this something which requires constant expensive repairs and may leave me stranded on the side of the road many times? 

Thank you for reading through this!

TLDR: what is the reliability of a clean 1980 Mercedes 300D? Does it need routine, expensive repairs or will it run mostly trouble-free?",1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,,2022-12-23T02:06:33Z,zt3p2j,t3

My mechanic said if MBZ was backed up, he could get it in and out before christmas, ~$400.

The dealership is 0.5 miles from there, they are 50 cars deep, I made an appointment for a week from now, the guy there would give me no details on what my warranty is or if it might be covered.

‚ÄúMr. H, here is the latest update on your E Class. The check engine light is on due to a failed bank 1 downstream oxygen sensor. Upon further inspection, the reason this sensor failed is due to oil inside the wire harness that is ultimately feeding oil into the oxygen sensor. Backtracking from there, we can verify oil leaking from the camshaft sensors. The oil leak travels from the camshaft sensors and into the engine wire harness and all the way through to the oxygen sensors. The repair will require replacement camshaft sensors (source of oil leak), replace engine wire harness (oil inside harness), and replacement oxygen sensors (all 4 as oil is leaking into sensors). The cost for this repair is $7,150. We did also hear a chirping sound from the blower motor. We assume this is the noise that you mentioned you wanted looking at. We will need to replace the blower motor. The cost for this repair is $950. There is also 1 additional item that did come up on the inspection report that I want to go over with you. We recommend replacement motor mounts $3,550 (excessive vibration felt). Please let me know if you have any questions and/or if you would like to proceed.

267,1671382454.0,mercedes_benz,Is This a Known Problem?,"Is the following a known problem?  I have a 2021 E-450.  Any clues appreciated.

The problem is the car will not start. When I try to start the car I put my foot on the brake pedal and press the start button. Nothing happens. One clue: when I put my foot on the brake pedal it feels locked in place; it doesn't move; I can not press it in.

The electrical system seems to be okay. The dashboard lights go on as usual, the sound system works, the windows go up/down but the car does not start.

I've had the car since January, 2021. So far I've had this problem twice: April, 2022 and today December, 2022. In both cases the symptoms were the same and in both cases there was no warning sign of a problem.

The first time it happened (April, 2022) the car had to be towed to the local Mercedes dealer. It sat there for five days before they even looked at it (because they are overloaded). Ultimately they did fix it and told me it was ""a known software issue that had to be updated."" I don't know if that's actually true or they just made it up as an excuse.

The car has been working fine since April, 2022 until today when I have the same problem again. I assume the car will have to be towed to the dealer again.

Any clues appreciated as to the cause, is it really a known software issue, what should I do about it?

At this stage it sounds like the entire suspension system needs replacing! What could the actual problem be, and is there a logical approach to checking / replacing parts?

305,1671303881.0,mercedes_benz,Steering wheel AMG buttons retrofit,"Hello everyone I recently bought a second hand E53 Coup√® 2021. Honestly the best car I‚Äôve ever owned. 

But being second hand you don‚Äôt get to choose the spec you want. It‚Äôs quite close to the one I would go for except two things. Burmester and the AMG Steering Wheel Buttons. 

That being said I‚Äôve come to peace with the Burmester because a retrofit will be near impossible or at the very least not well done. As for the buttons though, I‚Äôve seen people doing it. 

So my questions are:
1. Is it a plug and play job, and if so do I need to find a shop that can do it, or it can be done by an average Joe. (I‚Äôm pretty handy with mechanical jobs)
2. Will they properly work. I see no issues with the right one, since the dynamic modes are standard. But for the left one, I‚Äôm questioning the exhaust option for example. Since from my small research I think there is no performance exhaust option? Or is it standard? I really don‚Äôt know.
3. Can you recommend a place where I can order them from?

So I just bought my first car and it‚Äôs this beautiful model.

Sadly I experience a lot of problems.

My most important questions are if you experience something that I can only explain as a turbo lag and is it normal for the car to be moody at low rev either going forward or backwards. From what I saw the turbo is activating at somewhere 2500 revs which I don‚Äôt think is normal.

Also the clock on the tab and the one of the navi aren‚Äôt in sync. They have a couple of hours difference when I‚Äôm synchronising them. I don‚Äôt know why.

And what about the fuel consumption? I loaded 15 litres and went 75 km when the light turned red. I still can‚Äôt find at what level of fuel the lamp lights.

Thank you for your time)

Edit: So after I‚Äôve bought the car I gave it to the mechanic for maintenance. I told him that before the he puts the new oils, and other liquids that goes in to the car I want the whole system to be cleaned. He told me okay. 
So we changed the water pump and all of the rolls(?), 
the track belt(not sure what is called in English), 
all filters, 
bleed the brakes plus brake fluid, 
antifreeze, 
changed the small accumulator for the modules.

After that he told me that the car is ready to drive, he told me that the shock absorbers and springs are well so they don‚Äôt need to be changed.
And I wanted him to change the shock absorbers of the trunk but he told me that those are hydraulic shock absorbers and they are pretty expensive but I can‚Äôt find any in the internet for my car tho.
Also the steering wheel is like a rock. I asked him if he changed the fluids and he told me that he only supplemented them. 

Today I bought new wheels and after that when I went on the computer they told me that the springs are faulty, that the shock absorbers may need to be changed too. The steering tips are rotten and one may needs to be changed too better both of them and that I can‚Äôt drive the car until I do all of that. And the brake started to squeak.

The pads, although they still have material on them, are old and tear the discs and it is recommended to replace them, although it was still driveable.  I'm not sure",0.67,1.0,0.0,1.0,,2022-12-17T18:44:11Z,zoczen,t3

1.   The car starts fine after I had to turn the key in the ignition twice (What could be the main cause of that?)

2.       After I switch the car off it does not want to start again, and then I must refer to step 1 again above to start the car.

3.       Sometimes the car does not want to turn over at all after it didn‚Äôt want to start after two attempts (Complete silence, no cranking/turning)

4.       After the car starts again it sometimes dies in reverse/drive (Very rarely though)

So, what I would really like to know is why this would be happening? The fact that I must push they key in once, turn it to the number two position before starting and do it again before it starts and runs)

I know it may be difficult in this current market to get a lease on the lower end, but I do not want to spend over $670/month.

Will I qualify or another lease with my current credit score? 

What is the current wait time for C300 to come after ordering ? 

Do I qualify for a loyalty lease discount ?",1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,,2022-12-16T01:44:55Z,zn2tpd,t3

Some backstory, me and my friend decided to rebuild my 2008 C63 engine with no prior mechanical experience. The reason for that decision was to gain experience, have fun, and fix some common issues that were found in the M156 like weak head bolts which can cause white smoke that we also saw in my car.

 We only disassembled the top part and didn‚Äôt disassemble the pistons or crankshaft. We discovered that someone else had already opened up the engine, we also found out that there were dings and scratches on one piston‚Äôs head but didn‚Äôt think much of it. The whole process took about 7 months thanks to COVID. We reassembled the engine and it made great power at first, so much more power than it made before we rebuilt it, but that didn‚Äôt last long. A few weeks later, we faced every problem known to man, whether it‚Äôs electrical issues or mechanical, so the car sat for a few months. A couple months in after solving several issues unrelated to the engine, I started noticing a slight power decrease every couple of weeks until it was a big difference between when we first rebuilt it and now. 

About a month and a half ago I noticed a lot of oil consumption and a slight coolant consumption, so we decided to rebuild it for a second time. We took the engine out and disassembled it in about 2 days, and when opening the oil pump we found metal chunks and some silicone. We were kinda shocked and continued to the pistons hoping to find the culprit. We found out that the piston that was dinged and scratched had a bent connecting rod and broken piston (skirt?), as well as a broken part that I don‚Äôt know the name of in English. 

The engine was running fine, except for the oil and coolant consumption and a slight ticking sound from time to time. So what could have caused the dings, bent con-rod, broken piston skirt, and the broken oil distributor thingy?",1.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,,2022-12-15T13:23:04Z,zmkza7,t3

I was wondering if anyone knows if that means the calipers/rotors are larger and wouldn't accomodate an 18"" wheel and if I'd have to stick with 19""+ wheels?

Thank you",1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,,2022-12-14T14:50:41Z,zlsy0b,t3

I'm going to my dealer tomorrow to set up a custom order.  
The car is ordered by the 2023 guide and will be 2023, right? He assumed it would take roughly six months to arrive.  


What would be a decent amount to pay over sticker? considering the market state and allocations etc...?  


I was thinking of specing it in Monza Grey Magno and the Beige Macchiato interior. What do you think about this combination? Resell value? I find it the most beautiful combination ever !  
I am attaching a video of one like that.  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4w7V1-ODXs&amp;ab\_channel=RemaxAutohandelsGmbH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4w7V1-ODXs&amp;ab_channel=RemaxAutohandelsGmbH)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also going to get the night package 1 to get everything blacked out.  


I would also like to share with you a few of my concerns:  
1. This is not the latest mbux and the screen is not touch... Is there any facelift that is going to change it anytime soon? Maybe I should wait? I'm not talking about the Electric one...  
2. Can I remove or not spec the bull bar?  
3. Is there a way to get the side step and the exhaust tips also in black?  
4. There is no keyless comfort entrance? I mean, why do you need to press the button on the remote why it couldn't be by proximity lol that doesn't make sense  
5. How is it for a mom's car? Having a child seat and putting her in and out? how difficult is it? she's 5 months still seating backward  


Overall I feel that to achieve the holy grail some compromises have to be made... no power tailgate, no soft close doors or head-up display... and a lot of features are missing.. I hope that it will cover the missing by being a great and fun car.  


Any tips? Things I should know or notice before I close the deal?

I have a 2017 A Class Mercedes A200d 

My EGR Fault code keeps coming on - P0401

My car has done 40000 miles in total. I have already taken it to my local mechanic and he‚Äôs took the part out cleaned it and got all the carbon out. On top of that the Engine Light kept coming back after that still so I took it to a merc specialist and they fleeced me for money and said my flap actuator needs changing which I let them do thinking it would fix it and then the engine light came back, so i got them to diagnose one more time and they say everything looks sweet and they can‚Äôt work it out!

What I don‚Äôt get is, so when I drive the engine light comes on then it goes off at random times, I‚Äôve noticed what triggers the engine light to come on is when I am in slow traffic just creeping along, and then when I accelerate once the traffic clears the engine light comes on. It‚Äôs been going on like this for a while so I just want to see if anyone has had similar issues or ideas of what to do!

I‚Äôm in a place where I‚Äôve tried everything, do I try buy a new EGR valve and get it fitted? Worried incase it‚Äôs still gonna keep coming back after a new EGR Or do I get it EGR deleted aswell as a remap? 

Any recommendations on what I should do is welcomed, because of my cars age and mileage I jus want to check. 

If I did an EGR delete will it affect me when I go to sell?

544,1670704841.0,mercedes_benz,Looking for advice on 2010 C300,"Hello all, I made a post about a month back which stated the following

‚Äú‚ÄùI‚Äôve got a 2010 c3 and something has been bugging me for a few weeks. The scanner told me a cylinder misfired. Number 5 to be specific. So the first thing I did was switch the ignition coils, to see if that was the issue. However, the check engine light has yet to return and every time I scan the car I get donut. So now I‚Äôm at a loss, I‚Äôm not even sure what‚Äôs the issue anymore. The car runs fine. But I fear for the foreseeable future.


**Update: cylinder 3 misfired. I did not change cylinder 3.‚Äù‚Äù

Since then a few things have changed, mainly due to repeated trips to the mechanic. As for one I changed all six spark plugs and ignition coils; as it was suggested here and by the mechanic as well. However, the problem has persisted. 

Also my battery died that same night the second cylinder misfired. Could be related or could be bad luck, who knows. I certainly didn‚Äôt find anything of substance online. 

In any case, I have now noticed cylinder 1 has misfired. And unlike the the previous times, when the trouble code was erased by a OBD scanner, this code p0301 remained. 


*I know you‚Äôre not supposed to erase the code before the problem was fixed* 

The first time, p0305, was erased as I 
was checked the ignition coils. Yet that proved to be useless. 

The second time, p0303, was presumably erased by my mechanic when the spark plugs and ignition coils were all switched with new ones. 

This leads us to here. P0301. I understand now that the cause is most definitely the fuel injectors. However, my question is; would a fuel cleaner additive work? (I was pointed towards the chevron techron) or the more expensive response, changing my injectors. In this scenario, is it better to just change the one or bite bullet and change all six?


Important information to note 
Car has about 130k miles 
As stated above: plugs and coils have been switched for new ones 
Each time I received a check engine light for a misfire, the car was in sport mode and always around a high rpm range, say 4K and above.

589,1670565027.0,mercedes_benz,New GLC300 Coupe - Do I need to run out and grab a winter tire/wheel set?,"Hi everyone, after 15 years coming back to Mercedes with a new GLC 300 coupe. 

It's coming with the 20"" AMG 5 spoke wheels and I live in upstate NY- see lots of snow. 

I work from home but don't want to be canceling plans if there's a moderate snowfall. (within reason). I drive about 4k miles a year so no commute, just pleasure and occasional runs for the kids if I have to grab them from school for something. Wife has a Honda Odyssey. 

I was wondering if I should make immediate plans to get run over and get a winter wheel/tire set or if I'll be okay through my first winter with the OEMs - seeing as they're 20"" I wasn't sure what kind of tread and winter driving they'd be up to. 

My last MB was a 2003 C230 and ...that wasn't so great in winter without a winter set. 

This is my first 4matic and I've driven 24 or so years in the snow up here, so not green, but smart enough to ask for people who have experience with these cars and tires. 

It won't break the bank, but I did just throw down several grand and a trade on the new car along with some PPF so I'm not exactly pining to immediately drop another 2-3k on winter tires if I'll be fine for the next few months (and it is Christmas season and I have kids who like video games and apple products :)

Thanks for any advice. Coming from an f-150 4x4 but my previous car was a Mustang GT and i survived winters with that (winter set).",1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,,2022-12-09T05:50:27Z,zgoetu,t3

Are any of these two cars good:

[1995 Mercedes Benz E320](https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/link/343588674)

[1997 Mercedes-Benz E-Class - VIN: WDBJF20F6VA349957 (edmunds.com)](https://www.edmunds.com/mercedes-benz/e-class/1997/vin/WDBJF20F6VA349957/) 

Brief history of his cars:

He moved to the US in 1996, bought a 1986 Nissan Maxima in 1996, but totalled it in 2000

He then replaced it with the 1994 Pontiac Grand Am, but when he moved to North Carolina in 2008 to retire, his children decided to bring it to the junkyard. In North Carolina, he bought a 1990 Mercedes Benz 190E and really loved it

Once he got bored with North Carolina, he returned to Massachusetts in 2015 and that is where he bought the 1998 Toyota Camry LE since he knew he isn't going to drive much anymore (only 3-4000 mi per year). His car starts to break down though, so that is why he wanted to buy a new car, drive for 5-10 more years until he stops driving, then I might take over and use it as a project car

Fun fact: Warren Buffett, older than my uncle, still drives his Cadillac and still goes to work

My uncle and I are polar opposites in terms of design preferences. Whilst he loves the design of cars like the W123, W124, W201, Volvo 200 series, Jaguar X-Type, Lincoln Town Car, other Benzes and cars with the hood ornament and he hates sport cars, I love the design of cars like the Porsche Taycan, Tesla cars, Lucid Air, Hyundai Ioniq 5, etc. TL;DR: He loves boxy old school cars and I love sleek and futuristic cars",0.66,3.0,0.0,3.0,,2022-12-09T03:48:19Z,zgly5k,t3

I am bouncing between the Lexus IS-F and the E55 and was wanting an opinion from individuals other than my family who are currently torn between the IS-F and the E55.

I have run cost breakdowns of the two cars in terms of annual running costs and standard maintenance (oil change, etc.) and they work out to be similar so cost is not too much of an issue. I would however ideally want to spend less.

I don't think it's been wrecked, but I haven't seen any carfax...I know I've never wrecked it and I've owned it about 20 years.  It was a weekend driver until about a dozen years ago when life forced me to park it indoors, top down, covered.  I only put the top up a couple of times that I was driving it, when force by rain, but the top was ok then.  Who knows now, I haven't looked.  I also have the hard top and rolling stand. Anyway, the engine hasn't run since I parked it.  It was running fine.  Other than the typical old age issues of these cars, it was OK.  Oil dripping a bit, power steering gearbox loose and leaking.  The transmission worked well enough.  The windows worked slowly, but the AC wasn't cold, or even cool.  The blower worked.  Radio worked as well.  Body panels are all good.  Interior is age appropriate...no tears or rips.

I know that it needs a bunch of work just to safely try to start the car.  Then it would likely need more repairs for someone to feel confident in the car.  I don't have the place to do the work, nor am I inclined to do anything as major as pulling the tank and flushing the fuel system.

673,1670353256.0,mercedes_benz,From Audi to MB,"You guys are the all knowing and I‚Äôve gathered much valuable information since visiting this sub. I‚Äôm a single guy in his late 20‚Äôs considering getting into a E63 S. 

I have had mostly Audi and VW from Jetta - Golf R - A class Audis to S class - RS. I‚Äôve had a lot of fun and I‚Äôm extremely comfortable with the Audi platforms, I‚Äôve also never had any problems during ownership with unforeseen costs luckily. 

I test drove a 2019 E63 S about a year ago listed at $100k and fell in love but the cost wasn‚Äôt something I could manage at the time. 

Now I‚Äôm able to purchase the car but despite all my research I‚Äôm not much closer to knowing if it‚Äôs a good idea or not. I don‚Äôt know what the reliability record is but it sounds solid. 

I really like the 2019 body style maybe 2020 and trying to find the lowest possible miles/owners so usually in my area around $100k. 

Is the e63 S a solid car and worth the cost? My most expensive car has only been half that cost so buying this car would be the biggest purchase I‚Äôve made on a vehicle yet and I plan to own for 2 years or so. Possibly more depending on how it goes. Normally I modify my cars but would likely keep this one mostly stock.

I love the C63 but the E63 having AWD is a big selling point for me here in PNW USA. I love the estate body but it‚Äôs about $20k more where I am for one so I‚Äôd be buying the standard sedan. 

The other cars up for consideration are 
2019/2020 RS5 (sort of monotonous)
2019/2020 S4 (original planned purchase) 

Porsche Macan/Cayenne GTS/Turbo 
Porsche 718 GT4

I‚Äôm sorry if this seems like a dumb post, I just wonder what your experiences are with the E63 and if you would recommend it to someone who is new to the brand

The w206 i own is 2022 model but others are 2021.

Most vehicles have problems in their first year production, but it should be solved in mostly 2 service visits and in a short service time which should be less than 2 weeks for each service.

My other 2 friends are having problem with the their MBUX. One of them had a steering column issue which is fixed. But the MBUX closing/not working cant be fixed even after their 4th service visit.

Last week my vehicle didnt work and it said ""Engine Could Not Be Started"". After 30 min i tried again and it suddenly worked. In the same day it showed and airbag error and after that day it showed up brake error. They all went away.

There is also too many trim/rattle noises inside the cabin. My previous car was Bmw G20 and the build quality was way more better, it didnt had any trim noises.

So far my service experience is really poor. I know it depends on the country you live in but after-sales in Mercedes is horrible in comparison with BMW and other same class manufacturers. 

So, all of of the people i know and including me are having issues with W206 and i think Mercedes is not focusing on manufacturing reliable vehicles in the past years.

I‚Äôm looking at spending no more then 90k. I love the 2019 and newer c63 coupe but need awd and this is another major reason I plan on getting a new car in the next year. my quick opinion on the cars:

S63: it‚Äôs an s class so amazing interior even though it‚Äôs not the newest generation I‚Äôd be getting but that‚Äôs fine with me. Obviously the engine and I love the coupe and would prefer a coupe. 

E63: 2017 and newer. I love everything about this car tbh, the looks, interior, exhaust and performance but it‚Äôs a sedan which can be both a pro and a con for me. 

E53: I can get essentially brand new so can have all the new technology and they have coupe and sedan. Performance is alright and sound is nice but not v8 63 nice lol

My hope is to either upgrade to a four-door V8 or get a cheap SUV preferably Mercedes And drive my car in the summer 

I was told that my C 63 is worth around $55-$60,000 and I will get the best trade-in value if I trade it in now rather than waiting until spring. I am interested in either a S 63 or E 63 but the sales rep told me that if I choose the S 63 in a year time the value of my car will go down significantly which is obviously not ideal. 

I test drove the GLE 63 and I just was not in love with it for the price point, I am much more comfortable in a car rather than an SUV. I just am really undecided on which class to get as I feel like I am losing by getting a E or S class and I really don‚Äôt feel like buying a cheap GL C, or GLK but it looks like that might be the best option.

Other ideas s580 or E53 . I really enjoy the V-8 engine so I would like to keep within the V 8 However I did test drive the GT 53 and it was nice but for some reason I wasn‚Äôt in love nor did it feel like I was making a good decision for a winter car.",1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,,2022-12-03T23:45:52Z,zbuiqm,t3

764,1670084385.0,mercedes_benz,Disabling the rear / reverse auto brake feature. 2022 GLE 350.,"We bought our GLE 350 last November. During that year, our vehicle‚Äôs auto brake has gone off for no reason at all no less than 10 times giving us whiplash, causing us to immensely regret the decision to buy this car. For example, the auto brake went off while I was reversing in a totally empty parking lot. Yesterday it went off while my wife was driving because there was a twig in the driveway. 

I can disable the brake assist for the front of the car, but can‚Äôt find a way to do it for the reverse/backing up auto brake. We went to the dealer and we went to our local shop. Both sources said they receive a ton of complaints, but they can‚Äôt disable it. They can ‚Äúrecalibrate‚Äù it, which they did - but like I said, a literal twig in my driveway set it off yesterday. It‚Äôs also gone off on rainy days for no reason.

There must be a way to disable this. It‚Äôs completely ruined my driving experience and faith in Mercedes Benz. For no reason at all, the car will stop on a dime while reversing, upsetting my children and shocking the hell out of me. We will be trading this car in for a different one if I can‚Äôt solve this major problem. (Not a lease unfortunately, paid in full.)

767,1670079530.0,mercedes_benz,GLC43 loss of transmission mid-drive,"Apologies in advance if this is the wrong spot to post. I want to share a frightening experience that just happened to me on the highway. I have a 2021 GLC43 Coupe. I drive in Sport+ mode around the city and in Individual mode (essentially Comfort mode with a focus on fuel efficiency) on the highway. While driving in Individual mode today, the transmission appeared to randomly disengaged itself. I don't know if it was truly the transmission or the computer. I stepped on the throttle and the car revved but it couldn't engage a gear. My digital gauge cluster has the gear as the main display and it showed nothing. Paddle upshifts and downshifts did absolutely nothing. The car was basically in Neutral while in Drive. I quickly changed into Neutral and brought it back to Drive, all as I was guiding down the highway, and nothing worked. I had to turn on my hazards, had to slowly break to a halt, and my only fix was to turn off the car and turn it back on. In the middle of the highway! Somewhat fortunately, the car was progressively slowing down during all of this so the cars behind me were equally slowing down.

At the moment, I‚Äôm more concerned with getting proper cross bars than I am with getting a roof box as I‚Äôm half-tempted to just get a ski rack for the time being. 

So as far as roof racks/cross bars‚ÄîI‚Äôve seen some posts indicating that the OEM cross bars are no longer manufactured, but I see [these](https://mbparts.mbusa.com/oem-parts/mercedes-benz-basic-carrier-2478903100?origin=pla&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA4aacBhCUARIsAI55maHOc5bp8Te53DMb0w3TJAe4Bm3w2m8spiTYXJufSDlxThy-dnoscJkaAl_6EALw_wcB) pop up when googling and I can‚Äôt figure out if they will fit. If these will fit, then I think it‚Äôs best to just go with these, no? 

Additionally, I‚Äôve seen other suggestions online to get the Thule AeroBlade Edge system, but other folks have had issues with opening their sunroofs. That‚Äî coupled with the insane price as they only sell them individually and not as a pair‚Äîmade me cross them off the list. 

Any help here is really appreciated as I haven‚Äôt been able to find much comprehensive info on what will fit the W212 wagons. 

Many thanks in advance, y‚Äôall!

The vehicle wouldn't go past 15mph.  As you can imagine my wife was panicking at the risk of someone slamming into her until she was finally able to pull over.  Tried turning off/on, but nothing, still wouldn't go stop rambling and wouldn't pick up speed.  We've only had the car for a couple of months.

Car is still at the shop and will be for at least 10-15 more days while they wait for parts. They still have not been able to tell me what caused the issue, which is frustrating...  All I've gotten so far is tech found the valve spring broke so they need to remove the head to determine if the head needs replacement due to damage or just replace the valve.  Again, I find it hard to believe they don't know the cause and don't know if the head needs replacement, but have ordered parts already.",0.81,3.0,0.0,3.0,,2022-12-02T04:46:49Z,zabrvk,t3

831,1669881858.0,mercedes_benz,"Effectiveness of OM642 PCV Valve, EGR, EGR Hose and Manifold Cleaning","Hi All,

Post says it all. For those of you turbo diesel MB owners, how effective is it having these jobs performed? 

There‚Äôs a guy in Michigan who will completely ‚Äúremanufacture‚Äù intake manifold for this engine , ie completely remove all carbon buildup from existing manifold and add special coating to slow future buildup and rebuild the manifolds w push rods and everything and include a new improved swirl flap motor. 

Honestly, the intake job is quite hard. Even though he says he will clean the manifolds and even additionally the oil cooler ‚Äúfor free‚Äù if you chose to send it as well, you have to first remove the manifolds and then ship them to him and wait for him to ship them back. Just removing the intake manifolds alone It‚Äôs a long and intense piece of work. And I am having trouble finding a in-depth video that starts from square 1 (removing the y-pipe) for removing the intake manifolds on this engine.  

The other carbon gunk clean-up jobs I can for sure tackle myself like replace PCV valve and clean EGR and EGR hose of buildup. 

My question is how effective are doing any of these soot/carbon removal jobs? Are the results really as night and day as some people say and turn back the clock on the engine? 

This technically pertains to other diesel vehicles manufactured in the last 20 years as well, so if you‚Äôve noticed changes from similar work performed on other diesel cars/trucks I‚Äôd be interested to hear. I also read doing these jobs is better for the environment as it helps trap more NOx and was wondering how accurate that is as well. I have absolutely no interest in deleting anything on the car and actually like the fact the car ‚Äúpurifies‚Äù the air it drives through.

The storm also took down lots of leaves, which may have clogged the vents and could have contributed to the leak. Other than cleaning the vents underneath the windshield, any other suggestions welcome!

Long time lurker and many time almost purchaser. 

To cut a long story short, I have been looking for a car for the last two years and over that time with covid delays on orders and the mass changes to the electric car market, have changed my mind many, many times. 

The opportunity has come up for me to purchase a 12 month old EQA250 dealer demo that has 60,000 km at what I consider to be a really amazing price (obviously due to the high km).

I understand that generally speaking electric cars require less maintenance, however, I'm wondering if the KMs would raise any red flags that I should be aware of when factoring in costs for repairs. I'm aware of standard things like tyres will need to be done, but is there anything else that's likely? I've been told electric cars are cheaper in this respect, and things like brakes deteriorate slower due to regenerative braking so that's likely not a concern, but I just feel somewhat apprehensive as I don't have a high level of knowledge of electric cars.

I don't want to get myself into the position where I buy the car, think it's an amazing deal and get hit with a huge expense in six months that could have been foreseeable.

I looked in the owners manual as well and didn't find any solutions, so I'm making a post about it. 

We just recently bought a W222 S Class (2015), and I'm finding that the car automatically plays my audio whenever I connect it to Bluetooth. This is pretty annoying since I don't wanna have music blaring in my ears within seconds of connecting the car to my phone. Is there any way to have this specific function disabled, or at minimum work around it somehow? 

I've tried different combinations of starting the car with the music already paused, starting the car with the app completely closed, and starting the car with a different tab open like navigation instead of media, but the result is the same; my music immediately starts playing once the car connects to my phone. 

I have an SLK55 as well and none of this happens in that car, so my line of thinking is that there has to be something or some step I'm missing in the S Class which leads to my music not automatically playing when I connect it to my phone. 

For full context, I'm using an android phone. I'm playing music from my phones native music app, and not from Spotify or any other streaming apps. This car does not have Android Auto.

I recently bought my first Benz - GLA250e. The car is brand new from the dealership. I like a lot about the car like the soft suspension and the sound of the Burmester system. The thing that bothers me is the software bugs. In the few months, I own the car I found several software-related issues. The most faulty system is the Traffic Sign Assist - a paid extra that wasn't indicated as beta or alpha. Most of the time it doesn't recognize the traffic sign or it doesn't account for the extra conditions that are applied(an extra sign) - e.g. only applicable when the weather is rainy. I'm driving in an area with all standard EU signs.

I drove a lot of recently released cars(2019-2022) like Hyundai Kona, Volkswagen T-Roc, Golf, Volvo XC60, and Peugeot 208. All of those cars had much better traffic sign recognition. Some of them even show an icon for those extra conditions like a raindrop or a snowflake. I mean OCR algorithms and AI image recognition are very advanced technologies, so the issue should be fixable. BTW Mercedes seems to sell [the traffic sign data](https://data.mercedes-benz.com/products/traffic-signs). :/

I know many of you drive Mercedes for the mechanical aspect of those cars, but nowadays about 20-40% of the options that Mercedes is offering are extra software features. They are also trying to adopt a subscription model just like the other software companies. And they even have an app store. So I think they should have a bug reporting or bug bounty program and they should provide some kind of issue tracking so that we know which of those features we're putting money into are actually working.

What do you think?

P.S.: I took my car to the Mercedes Service shop and they give me a replacement vehicle - a Mercedes E class. Which offers an even nicer ride than mine. However, the car was running the same software as mine and the bugs were all present. A funny thing - because the car is more luxurious they put larger screens, but the resolution was the same, so DPI is better on the more budget cars.

The guys at the shop confirmed the TSA system is not accurate and the other bugs are valid, but they can't do anything about it. There is no software update, no ETA, and no issue tracking available - even for those guys working at official shops. Next, I'm trying to contact the Mercedes software department.",0.67,1.0,0.0,1.0,,2022-11-28T18:08:31Z,z73lqp,t3

I open the hood and have no idea what I'm looking at. We find the two batteries but they both look only slightly different than the batteries for my lawn mower.

Luckily, someone else let us use his truck to jump Dad's car and we went on our way but now I'm left wondering, with no clear answers in the owner's manual, how does one go about jumping a car off a new Mercedes and its weird, hidden, tiny batteries?

My 2018 CLA250 w/47K  had a fuel smell coming from it and it seemed odd. 

Looked under hood and saw a wet hose around the inlet to the HPFP. I went to Autozone and got a temporary hose cut out and I mended the problem.

Two things though 1. Could I get the part number for this so I can order a new one direct from Mercedes. 

Second thing is.... is there a TSB or recall? That LPFP line is still under considerable pressure, and if it fully fails that mist, it will spray out can get to the turbo and put your occupants in grave danger. 

M270 is a fantastic, simple, and reliable engine but that's a pretty serious problem. 

I just left the BMW camp too thinking I'd catch a break on the DIY work. At least this problem was a 5 min fix and I didn't burn alive. I would say mercedes cheap out on like something else but make those hoses indestructible and do a wrapped design so if it does burst, the depressurization is contained somewhat.

954,1669448568.0,mercedes_benz,MercedesMe app has an incorrect mileage amount.,"A little backstory to explain the situation in it's entirety. When I purchased my 2021 A220 4matic from the dealership in April. I did so knowing it came without the Hermes chip and that some features wouldn't be available until it was installed. However I was advised that sometime this year it would be ready and installed free of charge. Sadly there was no definitive or comprehensive list of all the features that were unavailable without that chip. The only thing the dealership was able to definitively tell me was unavailable was the SOS feature which was entirely useless in any way shape or form. I found out after purchasing that the MercedesMe app was also useless and I was unable to access or use any and all of its capabilities. Thankfully I received an email that the chip was ready last week and I immediately made an appointment for the 23rd, this past Wednesday at my local dealership. The chip installation was completed and one of the associates set up my MercedesMe account without a single issue.

Now that I've told you the backstory we can address the issue at hand. Tonight was the first opportunity I had to explore the MercedesMe application. While browsing through the options I noticed my vehicle's mileage was listed at 229,819... the odometer on my dashboard reads 20,052 miles. Initially, I thought a typing error may have occurred during set up which would easily explain the discrepancy. However, because of the numerical difference between the two numbers incorrectly typing the number 20,052 and accidentally ending up with 229,819 is completely implausible. Specifically with the fact that a keyboard was used with either the 10 key or the number's at the top. A typing error just isn't a reasonable explanation IMO. Idk I just can't make sense of how the mileage information is so drastically incorrect on the app. I did try to reach out to customer support but the call center was closed. I did leave a message for them to call me back. In the meantime I figured I would see if anyone has experienced something similar and can shed some light on the issue.

955,1669438594.0,mercedes_benz,Looking for Car Friends.,"Hi, everyone.

I've been a long time reddit lurker lol and finally decided to make a legit account.
The title is pretty much it. I'm looking for some car friends to talk to about cars and possibly hang out with if we're in the same-ish area. I have a hard time putting myself out there in public group settings so I really don't have any friends to talk to especially car related things.

For a long time I have been wanting to join the car scene as I really do love cars, but something has always come up (probably my excuses lol) and I have never had the chance. Recently, I graduated from college and I am currently pursuing my masters. The problem that I'm having is that this program is 100% online and ASYNC so I have very limited interactions with people other than a few family members and I just really miss talking to people, even the very little talking that I did in undergrad lol.

I have looked for car events and car clubs near me and the ones nearby seem kinda sketchy and takeover-ish and I do want to be somewhat cautious given the H2Oi tragedy. Then the ones that look decent enough to attend are 1 hour+ away from me. I've looked for groups and clubs all over Instagram, FaceBook, etc. and I don't know why reddit never came to my head.
Thats sort of the background of what led me to post here.

Now about me, I am based in NJ and really into European cars. I have a 2013 Mercedes C300. The majority of my formative years we're spent on VAG so a lot of my
""experience"" are with Jettas, GTIs, A4s, etc. I'm obviously biased towards Mercedes now after owning one for awhile lol. But nevertheless I still appreciate VAG and BMW. I'm also coming around to Lexus.",0.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,,2022-11-26T04:56:34Z,z4yiss,t3

Anyways, O‚ÄôRiley parts says that the code could be related to the PCV valve. I‚Äôm not someone to just try to DIY on my own so I did take it to my Indy shop. 

Turns out that the intercooler had a 1 inch sized hole on it which was causing air to leak into the turbo, messing up the pressure. Code said that the system was ‚Äútoo lean at idle‚Äù. It cost $765 to get that replaced. They smoke tested it after and found that the head gasket on top was leaking and replaced that too. Total was about $974. 

Sounds like it was expensive to fix. But I can‚Äôt afford to not have a working car. Anyone have any thoughts on the price I paid for it? I‚Äôm glad the problem was solved.

33,1672005117.0,Audi,Audi RS5 with reported damage on Carfax,"Hi guys,

Currently driving a stage 2 VW GTI from 2020. Only has about 23,000 km on the clock. It's great to drive, but it's lowered and decently modified. I live in a very wintery area and I underestimated how much of a nuisance it would be driving a lowered vehicle in the winter.  It's my daily. I know, stupid of me, but hey I'm an enthusiast, I couldn't resist. Not impossible to daily, but annoying enough I'm tempted to switch vehicles and let this car go to someone who'd use it as a summer car. 

I just saw a used  2013Audi RS5 4.2 V8 with \~ 115,000 km pop up for sale at an Audi dealership. It has a reported accident on it for about 13,000$ a few years ago. This normally would be a deal breaker for me. But would it be any more reassuring that it's being sold through an Audi dealership? Including the fact that they're offering a warranty on it at extra cost. I don't think they'd warranty it if they were genuinely worried about the extent of the damage? 13,000$ sounds like a lot although I wonder whether even a minor accident on an RS5 would carry a high price tag to repair. 

I think I'd love the N/A V8, AWD, and believe or not it'd probably be more practical than what I've got now. 

Horrible idea?

I've heard that although the 4.2 V8 can be very expensive to service, they're not in and of themselves unreliable. 

I put very little mileage on my vehicle since I live about 4 km from work. And I've got what most would consider to be a very good salary so could probably manage maintaining the vehicle.

I know most people are going to say just swap it out, and I am going to. I am curious for those who find out after the fact that non european oil is used - how fked is the engine or is it not really a cause for concern if it isn't a repeated thing?

80,1671930107.0,Audi,How my Audi ruined Christmas eve,"Let me start off by saying this, I have only owned this 2018 S5 Sportback since December 8th so it has not even been a full month yet and the car has 31,000 miles

I was leaving my girlfriends house about to head to a family members house 45 mins away for Christmas eve dinner. Within 5 mins of driving the car cut pretty much all electrical components and shifted itself into neutral, also displayed a message ‚ÄúEngine start system malfunction‚Äù I immediately pulled into a side street and put the car in park to which it then immediately turned itself off completely. The car will now not turn itself back on. The car will lock and unlock, trunk open, Audi rings show on the ground for the puddle lights but the car will not even try to prime itself or anything. I push the start button and it simply does nothing. 

I called Audi road side and they sent someone (which took almost an hour for them to show up) which I understand it‚Äôs Christmas eve and 15 degrees outside. The flat bed showed up and in the end the guy could not take the car even though it was in neutral the E break was showing off but the back tires were locked up and the car would not budge. 

Now i‚Äôm thankfully sitting at my girlfriends house again while I wait for Audi road side to find a wrecker who has dollys to get the car on the flat bed so it can get dropped off at an Audi dealer nearby. 

Ive been dealing with this since 4pm and had to call Audi road side because they screwed up multiple times. For this being my first Audi I am really displeased with all of this and have no idea what could be going on with this car.

Hi all,
I have a 2017 2.0tdi Q2 with a faulty heater matrix which has been slowly loosing coolant (about 0.5l every 6 months).

We took it to our dealership over a year ago to investigate the coolant loss and we were told it was normal and not to worry about it.
2 weeks ago the HVAC system stopped heating the cabin so we took it in to the dealership again for clear warranty work and they have told us it‚Äôs a fault with the heater matrix (which we knew) and said the work carried out wouldn‚Äôt be covered by warranty and quoted us over ¬£2500 to resolve the issue.
They have admitted to not pressure testing the coolant system and/or performing an in-depth investigation to what caused the matrix to fail.

They have told us that the repair wouldn‚Äôt be covered by warranty and they are only going on the fact that there was a minor coolant leak, derbies in the expansion tank and the HVAC system not giving out any heat.
Has anyone had this heater matrix fault before?  And what where your experiences getting it resolved?

115,1671894725.0,Audi,"Interested in a new RS3. I plan to track it, so I have some questions about motorsports capability.","Hello. I'm interested in a new RS3. It will not be my daily. It will be a fun weekend car that I plan to track(not autocross, actual road courses) 1-3 times a month during the warm season. I am no stranger to tracking turbo cars. I have a Veloster N now that I track which is mostly stock, minus the aftermarket intercooler and oil cooler. Even in stock form, my VN did phenomenal on track as far as being run 10/10s for 3-5 full 20-30 minute sessions. No switching between cooldown and hot laps, every lap is a hot lap with the VN. Even on 100+ degree days, it never went to limp mode. It does even better now that temperatures are kept in check because it can make full power for longer, keeping heat soak at bay.

Back to the RS3. I'm not completely sure that the RS3 is being marketed as a track car, but the journalists seem to think so. I am no so sure either, which is why I came here to ask. Can the RS3 be taken to the track, run hard for 3-5 20-20 minute sessions and not skip a beat or go in to limp mode? Can I run it as hard as I run my VN even in stock form and not have to worry about going in to limp mode at the sign of slightly elevated temperatures? I know all turbo cars(even those with aftermarket intercoolers) WILL heat soak. But each car handles it differently. Some cars pull timing to decrease top end power, while all other functions remain the same. Some cars just go in to limp mode. Which camp is the RS3 in? Is every lap a hot lap with the RS3?

Ditto for the transmission and drivetrain. Are the DSG, 4WD system, and torque vectoring clutch packs prone to overheating? The AWD system adds more complexity which means more things can go wrong. 

Are the optional carbon ceramic brakes track worthy? I've never driven a car with one, but I do know that CC brakes are ridiculously expensive to replace. Not only that, pad selection is probably very limited. Since I'm planning to track this potential RS3, I'm leaning toward a no-options build with iron rotors because track use will greatly accelerate the wear and tear on the overall brake system. Which means replacing pads and rotors more often. And the rest of the options are just not necessary for what I plan to use the car for. But I do with that the CC brakes and top speed limiter were separate options.

I know that VAG platforms have very, very high ceilings for tuneability. And that is great. If I get an RS3, I will likely focus on heat management first and foremost. Intercooler, oil cooler, and transmission cooler. Then wheels/tires and brake pads. I do plan to track it in stock form first to get a picture of what I feel it needs to fit my use for it, rather than just throwing parts on it and causing even more problems down the line. I will likely not increase power and instead focus on learning the car on track and do my best to get good times as is.

Thanks for reading through this. Essentially, I want to know if the RS3 is a good motorsports platform AS IS, without the need for major overhaul to make it track day capable without going in to limp mode.",0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,,2022-12-24T15:12:05Z,zubpty,t3

Work from home with flexible schedule, so no big deal if it's not super reliable. Good grocery stores are less than 1 mile away. I get a good rental rate through work if I need a back up. 

I'd love to have a sporty little Audi. Thinking of the A3. Found one for 15K. 2015 Audi A3 2.0T quattro Premium Sedan AWD - $14,995, 87,305 miles. Is that a terrible idea? I figured they run reliably until 110K miles? So 25K more miles, which is probably like 5 years for me. Or am I naive?

I could afford much more, but don't want to spend money on a car. If a $5k mechanic bill hits me, it won't put me in debt. 

Or do I really need to shell out for a new plug in hybrid so I never need to gas up because of my short distances? My garage already has a plug. But I'd be paying at least $30K for that, probably more.

The RS3 is amazing in every way, the 5 cylinder is truly unmatched. However, I have been craving for a v8 for quite a while. The screaming v8 from the rs5 has always been a dream of mine.  I have found several good deals over the months, but have been hesitant on making it happen since I don't want to rush into a purchase.  Would I be making a huge mistake selling the rs3 for a v8 RS5? Has anyone else been in a similar position?

&amp;#x200B;

Sidenote:

I don't track or race my cars, although I might do a couple of track events this upcoming year. Mostly used as a daily driver with occasional spirited weekend driving on the backroads. I have a couple of mild mods on the rs3, but I realized quickly that I don't want to spend additional money on parts/upgrades. It's a never ending cycle and the performance I'm getting is enough for a daily driver.",1.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,,2022-12-24T07:09:56Z,zu4cbt,t3

Having driven the A6 I can say it‚Äôs quick enough in sport mode, and not *too* floaty, being a sedan with a longer wheelbase. The SQ5 I chose because I see so many on here, S-car power, and the wheelbase is shorter. 

I‚Äôm curious to hear from B9/9.5 SQ5 owners about driving dynamics, both with and without the CETE lowering module. I‚Äôm hesitant about the SQ5‚Äôs because of the higher ride height - I don‚Äôt want to be rolling around since I tend to drive in Sport mode more often than not - and the steering feel which *could* be floaty?

156,1671834075.0,Audi,A4 2014 S line MMI 3G+ No Sound,"Hi I was wondering if anyone could help with this issue I've been having. Since last week I've been having to do a strange sequence everytime I haven't driven for 30 mins or so. When I start the car I have no sound... The MMI is on and says what's playing I can change sources and put the volume up and down but complete silence. To get sound back I have to turn off the car and sit holding the key until everything powers down and the handbrake lights go off then reinsert the key and the sound instantly come back? This has happened since I used VCDS but I made absolutely no modifications to anything other than enable Audi Drive Select so I could make the power steering heavier as it was way too light before, that was it. The only other theory I had was that also last week the temperature plummeted into the minus numbers so maybe it was a thermal issue but nope still happens the exact same as when it started. I've tried undoing what I did in VCDS that didn't make a difference and checked the cables to the amp also replugging them back in. Tried resetting the MMI, updating its software and checking fuses still no luck. Its also completely dry in the boot compartment so I'm at a loss now it seems to be that the MMI isn't booting the sound on first start and does it a few minutes later but I really can't explain why and the amp seems to be working perfect I did autoscan it and the only thing that comes back are 7 invalid data set faults in the radio section but read online that was harmless? I really don't know and have gave Audi a call and they are saying it's going to be ¬£144 an hour to diagnose so I thought asking here first would be worth a try before having to fork out that kinda cash in a couple weeks!

Got extended warranty but think they might just laugh at me if I try to claim for this, like such a silly thing to complain about. Is this something I can fix myself somehow. My drivers side headlight beam is wonky i.e. not straight, so having trouble aligning it. They say a picture tells a thousand words:

https://i.imgur.com/Wi7bKNY.png

Any ideas please? They are LED (not matrix).

I owned one of these previously with the same headlights and they were fantastic, I rarely even needed full beam, with these I constantly have to use full beam to see up hills etc. The auto level works when you start the car up but does nothing whilst driving. Go up or down hills and it doesn't move them to compensate. I think someone adjusted them out of range and broke it.

I've also always secretly been a fan of dat ass on these things.

I understand the motor mounts can go bad (fix with a tune to stop Cylinder Deactivation) and that the turbos are troublesome with their smol filter.  Does anyone know how much I should budget for addressing these if for some reason the example I buy is a complete lemon?  

I'm more or less wanting to buy this thing and drive the wheels off of it for years.  Hoping to understand what sort of dough I should stash away for the worst case scenario.

Last week, a car ran a stop sign (at low speeds) and hit the front right quarter panel. Because the fender went into the wheel well, I had to get the vehicle towed. I was found not at fault by both insurance companies. The vehicle is a 2019 Audi S5 Sportback Prestige (USA).
I got the appraisal today from my insurance company and am looking for feedback from those who are knowledgeable and have the time/will. 

Full appraisal, repair estimate, and photos:

[https://www.transfernow.net/dl/20221221cO97Kr0t](https://www.transfernow.net/dl/20221221cO97Kr0t)

It‚Äôs a 10.1mb PDF file. Let me know if there‚Äôs a better way to send it. I noticed they didn‚Äôt include a replacement tire or refinishing for the wheel. This is something I plan on vouching for. I did have some questions:

- the shop I chose is an Audi Authorized Collision Center. The insurance sourced a local aftermarket Fender &amp; Hood. Does aftermarket matter for these body parts? Should I push for OEM?
- If the tire needs to be replaced, can we replace both the front ones per Audi guidelines or will insurance not cover a second tire?
- After, the vehicle will need balancing &amp; alignment. Apparently, there‚Äôs a special alignment for cars with assistive cruise control 
- would the upgraded/optional sport suspension affect any repairs? This is a Prestige model with all the factory options. 
- Will it be obvious the headlight has been replaced due to the other headlight being older/aged?

I want to preface with the fact that I've had euro cars all my life (Volvo to a Fiat to a VW) so am no stranger to owning euro cars. Biggest reason why I'm stuck between both is that I originally was just looking at A3's but to get one to where I would want it, I could potentially save money by going the S3 route. Since the S3's already have a better interior, the better steering wheel, and the IS38 turbo, I'm personally leaning towards an S3.

It was a great car, but it was an absolute nightmare with its N54 engine maintenance-wise, even though the previous owner really did take good care of it from the time he got it new. So I guess I am looking for more reliability than that car by far. I will be getting any of these cars through CarMax with Maxcare, but the less trips to the service department the better.

So I'm looking into getting an Audi as a great all-around daily driver that will be comfortable for long trips, but still 3-series-esque Sporty when you want to have some spirited driving. Less cornering focus like a hatchback, more for highway passing, but can still corner decently well. I have a few models in mind, 2013-16 B8.5 S4 with the DSG, 2013-16 A6/A7 with the same 3.0T (supercharged), or an 13-16 SQ5 with the 8-speed. I believe this plant with a blower should be a little easier to keep running than something with a turbo like an S3. I'm aware they're all based on the same platform and may share some of the same underpinnings, but in that mix is there really a bad choice, or is there an all around-er that mixes the best reliability I'm going to get out of a European import with a fun car?

342,1671564236.0,Audi,Restore Factory Settings with Radio in B8.5 Audi S4,"Hello,

I've run into a bit of a snag. Recently, someone in my family got an XTOOL D8BT and was toying around (silly I know, never mess with your car unless you know what you're doing) and added a new feature to my settings called Battery Level. Similar to the oil level option, but for battery. Upon writing the code in and then using the new feature, I noticed a handful of setting options just disappeared.

I tried fiddling some more adding the features that went missing (TPMS reset, oil level, Windshield Wiper, etc.) and every time I added just one feature more would either disappear or be replaced. There appears to be no rhyme or reason as to what gets removed when adding a feature. For example, upon adding oil level, TPMS, A/C, and Seat Level all disappeared. The winter season is here for me, and I do not have TPMS nor Windshield Wiper (2 most essential features) since I just switched to snow tires I need to reset the TPMS and when it snows I need to pull the windshield wipers up...

My radio buttons are above the climate control, (so not around the gear shifter), and the writing says Audi Concert. Is there any way I can restore to the factory functions using the XTOOL or any other method?",1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,,2022-12-20T19:23:56Z,zqx4kg,t3

348,1671562136.0,Audi,[Question] Maintenance Repair Bill,"Edit: Dealer said warranty approved, so the 7k bill is now sub  100. Warranty now officially more than paid for itself. Will still look into trading in. Maybe when EV rebate comes out.

I have a 2014 Q5 that's a bit over 60k miles (edit: bought in 2017 at 10k miles as a Audi certified used). Kept maintenance at dealerships throughout. In the most recent check-up, it's reported there are few issues coming up, totally a 7k bill. They are things like engine mount, steering linkage, and suspension bushing. The car has an extended warranty, but I'm not sure yet if these are covered (seems wear and tear).

So, my question is ... if I make the necessary fixes as recommended, should I be expecting similar levels of repair costs in the next 15k or 30k miles? Or pass on the repair, sell it, pocket the diff as downpay for a new one?

In a not-pristine condition, the car is probably worth a bit 10k (?) as I did a brief look online. [it's paid off a long time ago, located in LA, CA.]

It doesn‚Äôt seem like there‚Äôs a massive price difference from low mileage (~20,000 km) to moderate mileage cars (~50/60,000 km). There‚Äôs a low mileage one I‚Äôm looking at (2019, 20,000 km), but it‚Äôs not in the spec I want (black, blade wheels, no red callipers, and odd decision to have blacked out logo, matte aluminium trim but carbon mirror caps‚Ä¶). Whereas other higher mileage (55,000km) are in the exact spec I want but they‚Äôre not a ton cheaper (maybe 8-10,000CAD) cheaper. 

Would you prioritize the lower kilometrage or go with a better spec? Or is 30,000 km here or there not a big deal if CPO?

Assuming they‚Äôre both CPO and I‚Äôd pay for an extended Audi warranty

I wanted to give some background into what I am looking for,  I have been living without a license in Europe for 5 years, and it is almost time to finally get that sweet EU Driver's license so I can legally drive here.  I am looking into B7 RS4 / B8/8.5 RS5 , price point is about **–Ñ30k.**   


Previous cars owned:

1996 firebird formula ( automatic )   
2008 335i (6MT)  
2001 Nogaro S4 (6MT) &lt;--- My favorite  
1984 533i LSD (5MT)  


Only my first car was automatic, and I feel like I have a love for Manual, especially while we can still enjoy them.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems I am looking at either RS4 / RS5 with between 120-170k KM, I know the background of both etc...   


Few things I wanted to ask the community is:

1) Do you believe both of these cars are at their low point depreciation wise?  If one was to only appreciate at this point, which one would it be?

2) Will I really miss the 6MT if I go with the RS5?  

3) Ownership wise, which one usually will cost more in maintenance / repairs?

430,1671417635.0,Audi,Audi RS5 vs RS6 Avant (or RS7??),"I am a tall guy so I think the RS3 won't work for me, especially with kids in the back. The S5/RS5 is probably the best looking Audi I've ever seen. I want a car for fun when going on trip outside the city. I always had Avants until they stopped bringing them to america (don't want an allroad with its raised height), around 2012 I switched to Volvo wagons and I have a Model S, which is great for driving in the city, or out east, but less than ideal when we head into Maine, Vermont or the ADKs.

Given all that, what would you recommend? I always said when/if Audi ever brought over the RS6 Avant I'd buy it. Now it is here. The RS5 is cheaper, what are the main differences between the two cars? But I am happy to compare the cars driving style and options while pretending the prices are all the same...

I am guessing the RS5 is still pretty rare (compared to the RS7 at least) but nowhere as rare as an RS6 Avant? I want something that can slightly stay under the radar and doesn't scream midlife crisis :) I'm pretty well acquainted with the RS7, so if you can compare the RS6 Avant and RS5 hatchback to the RS7, it will make sense.

It is hard to make decisions on RS cars since few dealers have multiple RS cars in stock. I'vew watched several 'reviews' on youtube but haven't found them very useful...is it me or is it most of these reviews are bland and they focus on racing it in a straight line against MB or BMW (i guess this gets the clicks?)?

Oh...is european delivery still available, we go to europe every spring and I wouldn't mind driving the car there?...

ORRRR I can forget the hatchback and buy an S8 (on another note i can't believe audi got rid of the 4.0t in the a8, what a travesty).

This will probably be my last ICE car, unless I buy a 911 Turbo S next (very unlikely). I want it to be fun, I want it to be safe, I want it to be comfortable, and I want it to reliable.

443,1671402040.0,Audi,Thinking of changing cars to a 2021 S3 Saloon and I have some questions.,"Hi! I have a few questions if any one could help that would be appreciated. 

The car in question is an 8000 mile Audi s3 Saloon from a main Audi dealership in the UK. 

I currently have a A5 Coupe 2019 for reference.

I test drove the car today and as expected it was super fun, the only thing I could really fault was the Braking.

It's hard to explain, it felt very very different (in a worse way) than my A5 and other Audis I've driven. The peddle didn't go down as far, it was way less responsive than my current cars, the first few Centimeters of depress seemed to not really do all that much and I seemed to have to press the brakes quite hard to get life out of them.

The dealerships said that its probably cus' the car's been sat around for 2-3 months doing nothing and maybe need new brakes (at 8k miles, that would be pretty nuts).

Could a car sitting around for a few months cause that kind of issue?


Secondly the tires on it were Good Years, I'm pretty sure if memory serves correctly Audis come with pirellis stock. &lt; 8k miles out of a stock set of tires seem quite drastic (the car has the 19 inch rims - 235/35/19). 

What kind of life expectancy can I expect out of a set of decent Michelins with a not too idiotic style of driving?

The car has to be used with 98 RON fuel, right?

Is the Up keep an maintenance of the car excessively expensive?

and lastly and most importantly do you enjoy owning and driving the car?",1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,,2022-12-18T22:20:40Z,zpa42c,t3

I asked them to remove everything optional so basically it was just the Doc Fee, tax and non tax fees. They kept pushing for me to purchase the 3 yr/36,000 mi warranty, even trying to bargain it down to $3,900.  I'm asking them for the details of the warranty since I didn't get it from them yesterday, but is this warranty worth it or not worth it? They mentioned they would perform the regular major service due at 40K miles of the car before handing it off to me and they have the record of the PODS recall issue being fixed.

This would be my first personal car purchase. I helped my dad get his new sienna, and now it's time for me to buy a car for myself for the years of hard work. I'm **very** new to the car market and even newer to the Audi market.

I went through many posts regarding the maintenance costs of the S5, but they all have older models with more mileage. What can I expect this to cost me year over year in maintenance as it stands? What should I check for when I buy the car?

**I really want to avoid dealing with constant (bi-weekly or monthly) sky-high maintenance costs.** I'd buy new, but that's out of my price range. I won't be driving the car like a feral psychopath, but I will push it hard from time to time. This will be my daily driver for the commute to work, to the gym, etc. I want to buy the car, enjoy it, do all the recommended timely checkups, change the oil early and often, etc.

I can learn how to do some basic maintenance on my own; please feel free to tell me what that might entail. I also plan to keep this car for at least 3-4 years.

Please let me know what I need to check up on, if this is a reasonable purchase/if I can get more for my dollar, what I should expect in maintenance costs, and where I can go to learn more about this car and cars in general regarding mechanical detail. &lt;3

However, since purchasing the car ~8 months ago, it has been in the shop twice, clocking over $8,000 in repairs to replace wheel bearings, the water pump, thermostat, engine mounting block, transmission mounting block and various other odds and ends (such as breaks and tires). Now, after all these repairs, I‚Äôm getting alerts indicating the start/stop system faulted and no longer works, and an alert stating ‚Äúbreak pads!‚Äù

It‚Äôs worth noting that I had all repairs and inspections done at an Audi dealership. So no third party foolery taking place.

This is so disappointing as I just can‚Äôt seem to go more than a few weeks without some new issue coming up. I love the car to death and I love the Audi brand so much. But at this point, as I hope you can understand, I can‚Äôt reasonably justify purchasing another Audi moving forward after this experience.

I don‚Äôt want this to be the case. I would love for Audi to recognize this is just a bad egg and either partially or fully cover the cost of the repairs. I wanted to post this to ask if anyone has any idea how I could go about handling this? Am I just SOL and on my own to deal with this? Or is there someone in corporate that I can talk to about this experience? Thanks for the insight, looking forward to hearing some feedback.",0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,,2022-12-18T03:50:50Z,zop7fq,t3

503,1671314317.0,Audi,Some question about 2022 Q5,"Hello everyone, 

Hope you guys are having a great weekend. I have some questions about 2022 Audi Q5. I'm a novice when it comes to car mechanicals and thought of asking you guys about these things since I'm curious. 

1. Is Q5's turbo oil or water cooled? Asking cuz with all my previous turbo cars, I've been following the idling rule where I idle for 30-45 seconds before starting off and before turning off the engine to avoid turbo wear due to oil burning. Is it needed with the Q5 as well?
2. Is the start stop mechanism damaging to the engine and turbo in the long run? I like the 12V mild hybrid system since it doesn't jerk as much when it starts the engine again when you lift off the brakes. But I'm wondering if it's harmful for the engine since shutting off would turn off the oil flow as well and it would cause the issue mentioned in point 1?
3. That brings me to my 3rd question. What does the Li ion battery in the 12V system actually run when the engine is turned off? I know the power steering works. Is there anything else that is run by the battery? When the car starts again, is it the 12V battery that provides the current or is it the main battery?

510,1671306176.0,Audi,Question about Active Lane Assist in my 2022 A5,"Hi all,

I've been searching around for an answer about this but still can't figure it out.

I have a 2022 A5 Sportsback Premium Plus with Active Lane Assist (supposedly) and Traffic Jam Assist. Currently:

1. Under 40 mph, Traffic Jam Assist can kick in and the car basically drives itself, changing the speed and steering in traffic with no problems.
2. Over 40 mph, Adaptive Cruise Control works to adjust the speed, but Active Lane Assist only controls steering in the ""Late"" way.

In the settings, I see no way to change Active Lane Assist from ""Late"" to ""Early"" (there's no option, it doesn't even say ""Late"").

Does this just mean I don't have ""Early"" Active Lane Assist? I thought it came standard on 2022 Premium Plus A5s. Also, how is it possible that I essentially have ""Early"" assist under 40 mph through Traffic Jam Assist but not above?

So far I have taken it to the Audi dealer and a couple local shops that specialize in German cars.   


I have some questions about maintenance.   
1 - Can I have the oil changed at a local mechanic shop if they have the proper filter and oil? Not sure if I'd have to let them know in advance so they have it in stock.

2 - What is average cost to change brakes / rotors.? I have the SQ5 prestige and I suspect I'll need to do this service in the next year. Does this need to be done by Audi, or can my local mechanic do it just as well?

3 - My rear backup light warning came on. The shop told me it would $600+ to replace the entire system (not just a bulb). That seems extremely high to me. Would it be possible to order the part and have my local mechanic install.

I began researching and realized I could build something relatively close to an S3 (minus haldex) with the early 06-08 FSI motor. With some modifications you could have something great. So, I found an ‚Äò06 (US Spec) Gen 1 A3 with one owner and 60k miles, 6 speed manual, that was optioned to the max and started building. Below is my mod list, and attached are the photos.

I bought a new A5 in April. They had the 'tech expert' install an audi app on my phone and connect it to the car. Never used it since, but seemingly almost every time i start the car, a message pops up an updates to myaudi settings that I can either discard (the message pops up next start) or accept. If I accept it sometimes takes awhile to sync, especially since I have bad service in my area.

So its really frustrating because I'm locked out of the screen while this thing that I don't even use or know what it does is loading, I can't access my Applecar play for music or GPS.

Another strange thing is I can't find the app on my phone, I am not finding it and am searching ""audi"" and only finding ""myaudi"" as a new app to download that isn't already on my phone.

Today is my first service, I had been waiting to ask them when I had it serviced, and the service rep just said ""I know nothing about that stuff, you have to talk to the sales person."" This was strange to me, he also mentioned something about soon I will start to be charged for this app?

To summarize: I just want to be able to start the car and seamlessly have applecar play connect and work without any barriers. Other than apple car play - I don't want or need any audi app or further tech connection - does anyone have any advice here?",0.67,1.0,0.0,1.0,,2022-12-15T16:05:46Z,zmordc,t3

So I just got my Q5 55e after waiting 15 months since my order in September of 2021. When the car was shipped in November, it seemed that Audi started to offer port installed illuminated rings (not door beams). There was no price on it and no pictures anywhere. so I took the risk and had them add that to my order. The option ended up being 500$, which was worth more than the door beam rings to me, and heck I saved on paint with Ibis white. So I wanted to post here so that others could see what that option looks like.

When off, it looks like a normal chromed logo.

I just finished getting matrix leds enabled and, added Jb4, and door beam rings, (now need a second set lol because prestiges have read door lights too. Probably going to get stainless pedal caps, an e-tron badge for the read, a stainless steel loading sill protector... get ceramic tints on front windows... man so much to do.

Also anyone get like laminx on the headlights? I did it on my Macan because those were huge and likely to get chipped.

Also having had an 2018 SQ5, they really made the Q5 much cheaper everywhere lol (interior wise and bells and whistles) for costing literally the exact same money.

682,1671048398.0,Audi,Used Audi RS3 - Canada,"Hi everyone,

Current VW owner. I've been wanting an RS3 (trade up from the VW) for about a year now, and have been looking at available used models for about as long, including keeping track of pricing. 

Just curious, with used car prices overall dropping, do you guys think RS3 prices will correct at all? I know they're pretty rare here in Canada, and even more desirable now that we can't get 2022+ onwards.  

Maybe I'm just not used to looking at prices for luxury vehicles, but I find prices for the RS3 are really nuts. Was looking at a few that have 50-60,000 km, both had accidents on Carfax for 4-5,000$ worth of damages and both going for more than they were worth brand new. Prices for models with desirable options/specs/colors tend to stay &gt; $65kCAD and those even with really high mileage and average options don't seem to ever drop below $55kCAD.

I guess I should probably keep waiting considering everything going on with interest rates, etc. etc. but just curious what other people thought!

I‚Äôm looking at purchasing a 2018 8V RS3. It‚Äôs Audi Approved Used, 33K miles, with a 2 year warranty, just recently had new brakes and tyres installed. 

I‚Äôve been to see the car, test driven it, and all seemed well. Until I saw the service history.

The car was first serviced at 18000 miles (2 years). An oil and filter change was performed. 

The next service (only a month ago, so another 2 years later) included another oil and filter change, and haldex oil change.

2 services (officially) in 4 years‚Ä¶?

This car is currently being serviced under Audi‚Äôs ‚Äúflexible‚Äù servicing, rather than the fixed cadence of 1 year/9000 miles. I was a tad alarmed to find out the car hadn‚Äôt been serviced at least once a year given it‚Äôs performance.

   Having checked the fob battery and with all other electrics working fine, I'm stumped on what to check next, from locating the correct relay to which wires are pertinent. 
The central locking button is doing nothing, manually locking driver door is correctly locking the other doors, radio and auto lights not shutting down as they would when engaging central locking (maybe stating the obvious there...) 
Extra info that probably has nothing to do with this: something snapped within the steering wheel front months ago and took out it's stereo/hands free controls, some part was replaced but these controls remain broken and a buzzing/humming sound can be heard at high revs on low gears coming from the driver side dash/steering area.

\- the dealer said PermaPlate was applied for the exterior and interior. I had them remove the charges for it and don't really care for it. My plan is to PPF the full front and ceramic coat the car. Any suggestions for local shops in SoCal (LA/LB/OC areas)?

\- I want to do a front license plate delete and black out the grill surround as well as the chrome trim around the windows. Is this good for the license plate delete? [https://europrice.us/plate-delete-trims-q8-sq8-rsq8](https://europrice.us/plate-delete-trims-q8-sq8-rsq8)

\- how do I disable the tips that keep popping up in the MMI? for ex, when I go into the Nav screen, it shows me where to put in the address, GPS features etc. For the 20th time :(

\- anyone else annoyed by blank switches? The car has all the tech packages except for Night Vision but I still count two blank physical switches (between parking &amp; driver assistance buttons and next/below the parking brake) and two in the lower display (first and last button spaces). The dealership had an RSQ8 which also had the same blank physical switches. What the hell is supposed to go on them?

\- even more annoying is to not get CarPlay directions on the HUD

\- is there a way to activate auto-lock upon walking away? or a timed delay? not sure if the key/car has sensors to detect approach or walking away

759,1670953379.0,Audi,"Audi, PLEASE give us this option...","Hello Audi community,

This is my first post, I'm happy to meet you guys and become a part of the discussion.  With that out of the way, I'm hoping that somebody at Audi will see this post and potentially offer a solution.  I'm talking about the the mandatory inclusion of Black Audi rings and badges with the Black Optics package (or lack thereof an option to pick between Chrome and Black).  This follows a current design trend from German manufacturers that, IMHO, does not look good &amp; takes away from the beautiful/classy lines of the design language.  I cannot be the only person who thinks the black badges look chintzy. I remember I first saw this on the B6 era of Audi.

I realize looks are subjective but I would at least like to have a choice in the matter.  I'm asking because I ordered an RS6 last February (finally the order was accepted in Nov thereby moving me from a 2022 model year to 2023) with an expected delivery date of around May 2023.  This is a dream car for me and I would have waited well over a year to receive it upon delivery.  I asked my salesman if there was an option to pick between the two- and there isn't (I remember somebody posting on Audizine that the badges were port installed, but I have since verified that as untrue).  For me, this car is a culmination of years of hard-work and saving.  I ordered exactly what I wanted, including an Audi Exclusive exterior- Daytona Grey Matte.  Even with the $9900 paint option, I still cannot get chrome badges.  The ONLY way to get chrome badges is to forego Black Optics/Carbon Optics packages which is not something I want to do.  I also don't want to go through the anxiety of having the badges on a brand new car swapped at a body shop.  IMO, it is dumb to not give us a choice on the badges, especially when ordering an exclusive exterior color.  I noticed with other models- the 2023 RS5 Coupe, for example, you do offer the the choice between the different badges, independent of the Black/Carbon Optics package.  I will gladly pay $300 for the choice.  Heck, I would pay $1300 for the choice.  Why would you not offer a choice on the highest tier models- RS6/7 and S8?

In any event, this is my RS6 spec:

Daytona Grey Matte exterior- Carbon Optics package - Red Ceramic brakes - Sport exhaust- RS design package (red) - Dinamica headliner - Audi side assist - B&amp;O advanced.

IMO this is the perfect spec'd vehicle...launch color and all the options that will not age or become outdated - a great sound system is always a great sound system.  Also, without all the driver's assistance systems, you don't need to look at the horrendous sensors that are jammed into the front grille (as well as not having to worry they will break in the future).  I have seen very few cars that do not have the ADAS equipped.  No Executive package either so not soft-close doors to worry about breaking- lets be honest, everyone slams the car door during Egress.

I took the bottom plastics off the car &amp; no leaks at all. Thermostat &amp; water pump were changed around 130k. At 182k now, this car drives like new. I‚Äôm the 2nd owner &amp; there was no mods or anything done on it ever. I‚Äôve driven about 5 miles since the light first came on (after topping it off) &amp; the car is driving like normal. Called my mechanic today but had to leave a message for him.

Should I be driving on this light even though the car has virtually 0 problems to my knowledge? Or do these lights get tripped &amp; need to be reset manually or something? Super annoying that this light won‚Äôt shut off but the car seems perfectly fine

Car #1 - I LOVE the brown interior with the sport seats and the black accents on the exterior but I'm not a fan of having 19"" wheels and this may sound petty but id like to buy a pretty low mileage car and while 30k isn't a lot id prefer less honestly

&amp;#x200B;

Car #2 - I'm not a huge fan of the beige interior and the first thing I would do is swap the wooden trim for a black or CF. I do like the low mileage on this one, with only 13k but this one does not have the black exterior pieces I like on #1, Cold weather package is not a big deal for me because I live in Texas and plan on getting an upgraded steering wheel anyways

806,1670870198.0,Audi,What Audi should I go with? Opinions much appreciated!,"So I currently own a 2013 Volkswagen CC 2.0T R-Line Stage 1 Tuned and the engine went out at 133,000 miles to you know it‚Ä¶.. the timing chain tensioner. I haven‚Äôt had a shop look at it but I know an engine replacement would likely be in the realm of 5k-6k since online engines with decent mileage( 80k or below) are running around 3-4K and then there‚Äôs the possibility the engine I buy also goes to crap. I love my car but I do have my gripes with its speed and potential and also reliability. Ultimately, even with a Big Turbo, FBO, Etc‚Ä¶ the CC 2.0 Platform just isn‚Äôt that fast or practical with fwd. Then at best I‚Äôll be able to keep up with big v8‚Äôs but at the end of the day that guy who has the Scatpack, Camaro SS, Mustang Gt, will be right there with me or I can possibly even lose. 

With that being said I currently have my eye on the Audi S3 2015+ ( since I know the mqb platform makes tons of power and is also more reliable), and an Audi S4 b8.5 /A6 c7 since the 3.0T platform would just be something refreshing over the usual 2.0T and also reliable so I‚Äôm really leaning towards that. 

I‚Äôve been doing my research and ultimately a FBO Dual Pulley 3.0T falls short of the 2.0 and seems to be around a 2.0T of the MQB Platform with Stage 2 FBO and definitely with a turbo upgrade the 2.0 surpasses it, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but that‚Äôs what it looks like and also from seeing numbers. A dual pulley 3.0T is definitely faster but still around that level of Mustang GT 10 Speed, ScatPack and etc but so is a 2.0T with stage 2 and with a turbo upgrade the 2.0T blows both out of the water and can even keep up with hellcats, GTR‚Äôs, etc. 

Now my price range is 20-25K and I‚Äôm a bit of a gearhead so I definitely like to have some speed behind my daily. I really think I‚Äôd enjoy the 3.0T platform but compared to the 2.0T in terms of tuning potential it just falls short, but it sounds so much better and the torque is always there lol. Which car do you guys recommend I go with or should I just look at another Audi or car in this price range ? Recommendations are appreciated. (P.S. I know a BMW would likely satisfy my gripes but I don‚Äôt want to turn to the dark side or pay the maintenance ;( and I love VAG) 

Also if any of you guys have a b8.5 S4/C7 A6 or 2015+ S3 feel free to share you guys‚Äô experience with the car so maybe I can get a better scope of things.",0.67,1.0,0.0,1.0,,2022-12-12T18:36:38Z,zk7a3q,t3

850,1670802596.0,Audi,B9 Audi A4 B&amp;O Speaker Rattle FIX,"Super easy fix. After some ingenuity from a friend, we determined the way to fix the subwoofer rattle is to dampen the sound in 2 places. Remove both speaker covers carefully from the rear shelf and apply 3M adhesive on the sides and front edge as the rear has the slip in tabs and could be a tight fit or not fit at all. They are held in place by a couple of tabs underneath from the trunk. Look through the holes in the metal from the truck side by the sub and you will see the 2 plastic tabs. Squeeze the tabs gently to release the speaker covers and disconnect the speakers. Now, go underneath from the trunk and cut some foam to size and stuff it in the big areas to put some tension on the back cover to absorb any movement and prevent rattle of the shelf (which Audi seems to have put a TINY amount in as well) and fill it right up and push it to both sides of the speakers. 

Voila, that‚Äôs literally all it took to get my speakers sounding incredible again with full bass settings and about 90% sub volume. It will work flawlessly and has so far. I am going on a weekend trip and will report back if for some reason it doesn‚Äôt work after extended useage.

877,1670760650.0,Audi,Question about tuning &amp; German laws,"Hi everybody,
this post/question is mainly directed towards my fellow German Audi owners, but feel free to read and learn about German traffic/car laws :)

So I'm about to tune my car (Audi S4 B8.5 8K) using the Stage 1 software (ECU &amp; TCU) from MTM. The tune has a certificate (Allgemeine Betriebserlaubnis, short ABE) from the T√úV which enables you to register the changes made by the tune (new emissions, new horsepower, new highspeed, etc.) with the proper authorities and have it written down in your vehicles papers. 
Unfortunately, this certificate requires the car to be in its OEM state (no other changes which affect the same areas of the vehicle). 

Now the problem: I had the chance to buy a Capristo valve exhaust, which has a certificate on its own (Teilegutachten) but it requires the car to be in its original state as well. 
Those two certificates collide and the authorities (T√úV) won't allow you to register those two changes. You'd have to pay a lot more and have to pass all the tests (noise- &amp; exhaust emissions) for this specific combination again (Einzelabnahme) which were previously done by the manufacturer for each part on its own.

Has anyone done this? Any experiences or tips for me? How much did it cost?
Is there any chance someone already has this combination (Audi S4 B8 3.0 TFSI V6, Euro 5 with MTM ECU Tune and Capristo Exhaust) registered and is willing to give me his papers as reference so I don't have to pass all tests again?

I appreciate any comments on this!

I have always liked this car and in my venture into the weekend car game, I found mine in stupid good condition for a fair price and jumped on it as it was 20-40k less than the P cars I was also looking at.  

Fast forward a few years and it turns out I love having a weekend car.  I look forward to driving it and I smile with every down shift and down press of the pedal.  I also put on catless midpipes so enjoying the sounds.  However I can‚Äôt shake an itch looking at 911s and the new lotus Emira.  I know in my mind at a net 40k difference I don‚Äôt think it will be ‚Äúworth it‚Äù, but the itch is getting stronger and it is only these two cars that have my eye. 

I like having a weekend car so much I feel justified to go more, but my mind says that diminishing returns would start to get high.  I mean, I wouldn‚Äôt want a lambo, realistically my ttrs is as fast as something can be and enjoy it on the road, so that would be a waste in terms of fun even if I could afford it.   I‚Äôm looking at cars specifically that I won‚Äôt be faster than what I already have because I think that 350-400hp is the enjoyment sweetspot but don‚Äôt want to pay double for what ends up being leaving a bit of an Audi unicorn for a lateral fun move that just looks a lot better.

The sound seems to mostly go away the second I barely put the window down however there still is a little bit of the sound. If I put the window down all the way it's gone. I've found someone else on a forum had the same problem and he took it to a dealer and they fixed it. They seem to have found a screw/bolt loose on the window regulator. My question is has anyone else here experienced the same problem? and if you fixed it yourself? I really don't want to take it to an Audi dealer if it's a super simple fix that one could do on their own and not get charged an arm and a leg. Otherwise if it's a pain to fix I will take it to a local Euro shop that specializes in Audi/Merc etc...

Both are blazingly fast cars, both are made to be able to do double time as track cars. With the added advantage of back seats and a roomy hatch and likely less money for insurance in the RS7, is there a reason someone would pay almost twice as much for the R8?

954,1670626576.0,Audi,Audi Allroad c5 2.5tdi v6 white/blue smoke on warmup,"Audi allroad has white/blueish smoke that doesn't appear straight upon starting.

Happens after its idled for about a minute.

Then smokes for about 20 mins until the car has been at operating temps for about 5 mins then it improves and then disappears completely.

During the periods of smoking if I blip the throttle it comes out in plumes

There has been a slight chatter at low revs that goes away in the higher rev range and a very silent ticking noise that can be barely heard over the sound of the engine. This has developed since owning the car but could be unrelated due to the smoke being a very recent issue.

Id say the smoke has a strong diesel smell no smell of coolant but I will be checking with a coolant leak test just incase.

It feels slightly down on power since I first purchased the car last year but nothing major.

No warning lights on the dash, no error codes, 74k miles.

The turbo may have become a little louder possible turbo issue?

In general it sounds okay but it doesn't run as smooth as it did a year ago.

Could someone clarify how much of an issue this is? I find it even more concerning that there is no remedy available.

I have attached an excerpt of the manufacturer recall.

""**Description:** Due to tolerance deviations, the distance between the fuel level sender and a ventilation pipe in the tank may be too small. As a result, the fuel level sender may get stuck on the ventilation pipe which will lead to a drop in the fuel level not being detected and therefore to an incorrect fuel level and remaining range being displayed in the instrument cluster. This may cause the vehicle to run out of fuel even though the indicator shows that there is still fuel in the tank. Inaccurate fuel indication may lead to an engine stall due to fuel starvation, increasing the risk of a crash.

**Remedy:** Repair Not Available""",1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,,2022-12-09T18:46:21Z,zh57dl,t3

I love the RS and have learned to do some standard maintenance to it such as oil/filter change, spark plug replacement, and brakes. Since this is a fair weather car for me that is garaged in the winter, I am looking to get an A4 or A5 in the year range of 2013 - 2018 and wanted to get owners opinions of this body and engine. Also I will be getting a manual transmission and was wondering id there is anything to look out for there as well. Thanks!",1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,,2022-12-09T13:48:28Z,zgxt70,t3
